title: 2a Overview - Scales and Scale Degrees - Diatonic, Pentatonic, and Chromatic
---

In this course, we will be studying many styles of music, but all of these will have  roots in the harmonic and melodic practices of the common practice period. The common practice period is generally accepted to include Western art music from the Renaissance through the late Romantic eras, but much of modern popular music can be analyzed using similar methods.

Whereas intervals are the most basic building blocks of all music, *scales* represent the next step up the complexity ladder. Whenever you stack any number of pitches from top to bottom, you create a scale. A scale is a collection of pitches from which a defined intervallic pattern can be extracted -- in short, a series of intervals -- and can encompass any tuning system or style of composition.

We will explore some extended scales later in this course, but certain scales are at the core of all common practice harmony, and as a music student, you are likely already familiar with these: *major, minor, pentatonic, and chromatic*.

Using the examples on the next page, create definitions and/or simple explanations for:
- the intervallic pattern of the *major* scale and all forms of *minor* scales
- how major and minor *pentatonic* scales relate to the major and minor scales
- why *natural, melodic,* and *harmonic* minors are named as they are
- the names for each scale degree and the Latin spelling of solfege
- the relationship between a major scale and its *relative* and *parallel* minors
