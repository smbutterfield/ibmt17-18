At its core, mode mixture explains why certain tones can be borrowed from parallel modes -- thus altering chord qualities -- but retains the function. If a diatonic chord would have a pre-dominant function, altering an individual tone by a half-step will not alter the function. It creates color.

If a chord functions as an embellishing chord such as a passing or pedal chord, then it will retain that function even if one or two pitches are borrowed from the parallel mode. The voice-leading that defines a chord's function is often strengthened by creating resolutions that rely on half steps rather than whole steps.
