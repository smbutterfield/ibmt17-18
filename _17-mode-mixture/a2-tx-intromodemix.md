# Class discussion
## Mode Mixture 
Mode mixture makes almost any chord viable.
Mode mixture allows you to share chords from different modes when you're in one of the modes. 
As an example, if you're in C major, you can use chords from C minor. 
From a voice leading perspective, the two modes are exactly the same. 
Because the voice leading is the same, you can borrow chords from the parallel minor without changing the key. 

Each of the modes have overlapping chords. 
The chords in C major are C, D-, E-, F, G, A-, Bo.
The chords in C minor are C-, Do, Eb, F-, G, Ab, Bo.
The two modes share G and Bo, so we have many options of chords to borrow. 
If we are in major, borrowed chords include C-, Do, Eb, F-, and Ab. 

What tones need to be altered to use a borrowed chord? 
- the 3rd and the 6th
  - the 3rd and 6th are the tones that are lowered when we use chords from the parallel minor.
  
#### Example 1: Borrowing Chords from the Parallel Minor
Progression: I - vi>VI - ii>iio - V - I
- you can borrow the VI or iio in this example

In minor, what are our tendancy tones?
- le wants to resolve down
  - if you resolve le up you've created an augmented 2nd in a moving line

#### Example 2: More Borrowing Chords
Progression: I - ii6 - V7 - vi - IV6 - vii%7 - I

Where can you use mode mixture?
1. ii6 can be iio6
2. vi can be VI
3. IV6 can be iv6
4. vii%7 can be viio7
  - this is the most common borrowed chord
5. I or V can be altered if you're feeling adventurous.
  - more likely used in minor to have a picardy third on the last tonic (major I).
- establish your key before you alter it
- make sure you are actually building the chord from the parallel minor
  - in C major, you would borrow Ab from C minor, not A. 
  - accidentals matter
  - Batman movies love to use a bVI (like Ab).
  
 The whole point of borrowing chords is to create smooth lines.
 If you want an inner voice to shine, use borrowed chords.
 
 #### Example 3: Borrowing Chords from the Parallel Major
 Progression: i - iio - V7 - VI - iv6 - viio7 - i
 - borrowing from the parallel major is much more difficult than borrowing from the parallel minor
  - you're borrowing and it's a deceptive resolution
  - iv makes it sound like you've modulated, and the viio creates bad voice leading
 - the picardy third is the only commonly used borrowed chord from major
  - a picardy third is a major I chord in a minor key
