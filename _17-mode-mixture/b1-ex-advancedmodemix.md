## Chromatic non-chord tones versus mode mixture

Chromatic passing tones often create harmonies that could be considered borrowed chords, but the simpler answer is usually preferred. If a tone can be classified as a chromatic passing tone, then it should probably remain that way. If the chord operates as a functional substitution (tonic, dominant, pre-dominant), then it is better to label it as a borrowed chord. If it assists in voice-leading, then it will have an alternate function such as a passing or pedal chord.
