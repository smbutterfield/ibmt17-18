title: Overview 10a - Fundamentals of Part-writing
---

The term "part-writing" implies many things, but for our purposes, this will be our first attempt to combine the fundamentals of melody (counterpoint) and harmony (voice-leading from circle-of-fifths progressions) into functional music using diatonic tonality. 

By simply applying the various skills and techniques that we have studied thus far, we can:
- Harmonize a melody
- Compose a melody given a harmony
- Fully voice chords
- Create independent melodic lines that function harmonically together

The goal of Units 10 and 11 are to solidify this process, beginning with a demonstration of the fundamentals of part-writing using only our basic knowledge, then exploring the stylistic errors of four-part chorale writing, and finally exploring the full application of part-writing in a chorale style.

We will be referring to Dr. Butterfield's handout, [Part-Writing Error Checklist and Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s9Xd3LPqoaEevshTopxHzLX9jCzxVCZocOBLD_dceMU/edit?usp=sharing), for the next two units, so you may want to print this out.
