## Part-Writing Errors

There are four main part writing errors:
1. Parallel octaves or fifths
2. Contrary octaves or fifths
3. Unequal fifths and octaves
4. Similar octaves or fifths 

### Parallel Octaves and Fifths
- a perfect octave moving to another perfect octave in parallel motion in the same voices
- likewise with a perfect fifth

#### Parallel Octave Detection
Ex:
  - A V7 chord: there is a B in the soprano, an F in the alto, a B in the tenor, and a G in the bass.
  - A I chord: it moves to a C in the soprano, an E in the alto, a C in the tenor, and a C in the bass.
  
Both the soprano and tenor voices resolve upwards from a B to a C. 
Those are parallel octaves. 
It could have been avoided by not doubling the third in the V7.
Part-writing errors are a result of bad voice leading. 

#### Parallel Fifth Detection
Ex: 
  - A I chord: A C in the soprano, an E in the alto, a G in the tenor, and a C in the bass.
  - A ii chord: An A in the soprano, an F in the alto, an A in the tenor, and a D in the bass.
  - A V7 chord: A B in the soprano, an F in the alto, a D in the tenor, and a G in the bass.
  
  The tenor and bass voices move in parallel perfect fifths between their notes moving from the I - ii - V7. 
  The overtone series makes the notes melt together and makes it more difficult to hear. 
  
### Contrary Octaves and Fifths
- conrary octaves are two perfect octaves in a row moving in contrary motion but still existing in the same voices 
- any of these can be avoided by not having fifths or octaves in the same voices consecutively

### Unacceptable Unequal Fifths
- must occur between the bass voice and one of the upper voices
- has to be a diminished fifth moving to a perfect fifth
  - a perfect fifth moving to a diminished fifth is fine
#### Unacceptable Unequal Fifth Detection
Ex:
- In C, for a dominant function, there is a B in the bass, and an F in the soprano
  - this could either be a V6/5 or a viio
- It resolves to the tonic, moving the bass to a C, and the soprano to a G.

This is an example of an unacceptable unequal fifth because it moves from a diminished fifth to a perfect fifth between the bass and an upper voice. 
Again, part-writing errors are symptoms of poor part writing.

### Similar Fifths and Octaves
- also called direct and hidden fifths and octaves
- has to be between the soprano and the bass voices
- requires a skip of a third or more in the soprano line
- when the soprano and bass voices move in similar motion and create a perfect fifth or octave on the second chord

The voices do not have to come from a fifth or octave, rather the rule avoids voices from moving in similar motion to a fifth or octave.
