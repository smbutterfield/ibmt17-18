## Error Detection

#### Similar octaves
Look for:
- movement in similar motion
- between soprano and bass
- a leap in the soprano voice
- leads to an octave

#### Parallel Perfect Fifths
Look for:
- voices that move in parallel motion
- the same horizontal intervalic motion between voices
- leads to a fifth

#### Parallel Perfect Octaves
Look for:
- voices that move in parallel motion
- the same horizontal intervalic motion between voices
- leads to an octave

#### Unacceptable Unequal Fifths
Look for:
- similar motion in similar intervals
- a diminished fifth
- a perfect fifth
- a diminished fifth moving to a perfect fifth
  - a perfect fifth moving to a diminished fifth is okay
  
#### Contrary Perfect Octaves
Look for:
- movement in contrary motion
- horizontal intervals that add up to make an octave
  - 2,7; 3,6; 4,5; 6,3;7,2.
- vertical intrval of an octave between voices

#### Contrary Perfect Fifths
Look for:
- movement in contrary motion
- horizontal intervals that add up to make an octave
- vertical interval of a fifth between voices

### Detecting Part-Writing Errors

1. Number the horizontal intervals
2. Look for Similar Octaves (follow those steps)
3. Look for Parallel Fifths and Octaves (follow those steps)
4. Look for Unacceptable Unequal Fifths (follow those steps)
5. Look for Contrary Perfect Fifths and Octaves (follow those steps)

Label part-writing errors with their given abbreviations and lines connecting problem voices.
Remember: part-writing errors are symptoms of poor voiceleading.
You also need to look for poor voiceleading errors to assist in your error detection.
