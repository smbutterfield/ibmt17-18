**Harmonize the following melody in a four-part chorale style by:**
- Choosing a diatonic progression that begins and ends on tonic.
    - This will establish your key center. Refer to Unit 6b for a review of the three primary harmonic functions: tonic, dominant, and pre-dominant.
- Choosing a cadence for the end.
    - Refer to Unit 7c to review the types of cadences.
- Composing a bass line based on your harmonization.
    - This will resemble 1:1 counterpoint, so refer to Unit 5b.
- Filling in the alto and tenor voices.
    - Refer to the rules for voicing, range, and doubling in Unit 6b.
- When writing your parts, always strive to have voice-leading that is as smooth as possible by emphasizing stepwise motion.
    - Bass lines are the exception and will often have more leaps.
