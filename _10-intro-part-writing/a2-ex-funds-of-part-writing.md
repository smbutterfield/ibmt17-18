**Harmonize the following melody in a four-part chorale style:**
- **Choose a cadence** for the end.
    - Refer to Unit 7c to review the types of cadences.
- **Create the rest of the diatonic progression** that begins on tonic and ends with your cadence. (If not already provided.)
    - This will establish your key center. Refer to Unit 6b for a review of the three primary harmonic functions: tonic, dominant, and pre-dominant.
- **Compose a bass line** based on your harmonization.
    - This will resemble 1:1 counterpoint, so refer to Unit 5b.
    - Contrary motion against the soprano line is preferred.
- **Fill in the alto and tenor voices.**
    - Refer to the rules for voicing, range, and doubling in Unit 6b.
- When writing your parts, always **strive to have voice-leading that is as smooth as possible** by emphasizing stepwise motion.
    - Bass lines are the exception and will often have more leaps, especially when using root-position chords.
