title: Overview 10c - Error detection
---

We have now studied the full array of part-writing errors for four-part chorale style compositions. Because there are so many possible errors, it can feel overwhelming to begin looking for errors, and it is easy to miss errors in long examples. I have developed a method for systematically identifying part-writing errors, and it not only helps to limit errors, it also helps students to understand the vertical and horizontal interactions that create part-writing errors.
