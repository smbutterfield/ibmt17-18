title: 12a Overview - Instrumental Transposition
---

Now that we have a functional understanding of diatonic harmony, we can begin analyzing scores that use instruments other than voice or piano. To do this, you will need understand how to read instruments that are not written in concert pitch. For various practical and historical reasons, *transposing instruments* create a different pitch than the one written on the page. For example, when a B&flat; clarinet sees a written 'C', the pitch that will actually sound is a 'B&flat;'.

This concept is not difficult to understand, but in practice, it often confuses the beginning analyst (or conductor), because transposition is the process by which we *compensate* for an instrument's transposition. If we were to write for a B&flat; instrument, is sounds a whole-step *lower*, so we must write the part a whole-step *higher*. Conversely, when reading a B&flat; transposed part, we must read it a whole-step lower, because it is written a whole-step higher than sounding. 

It is easy to transpose in the wrong direction when having to constantly flip back and forth between concert pitch and the transpositions, so it is important to have a complete understanding of transposition for each instrument. Luckily, they can be grouped into relatively few categories.
