#Range

Instrument and voice ranges are self-explanatory, but there are a wide variety of caveats that affect the extremes for almost every instrument. Brass players and vocalists, for example, have a wide variation of how high and low an individual can comfortably perform depending on the experience of the performer. Some instruments can be physically altered such as the bassoon, double bass, and piano to add more range. Because of this variation, you should always research an instrument before you choose to compose for it. For our part-writing, we will use the ranges from this helpful resource compiled by Dr. BJ Brooks. 

[Orchestral Instrument Ranges and Transpositions](http://octatone.com/orchestral-ranges-transposition/)

Note that the ranges provided are the **written ranges** for each of the instruments. If you want to find the sounding range, you will need to apply the transpositions that follow each staff.

#Transposition

###Non-transposing instruments (in C)

Non-transposing instruments are the easiest to understand, because they read and sound at the pitch written. This group includes:
- voice
- piano
- violin
- viola
- cello
- flute
- oboe
- bassoon
- trombone (alto, tenor, and bass)
    - Do not be confused when trombonists talk about their instrument as a B-flat instrument. The fundamental of the trombone is a concert B-flat, but it *always* reads from parts written in C. It is a non-transposing instrument.
- euphonium/baritone
- tuba
    - This is another often confused instrument. Tubists have a variety of tubas from which to choose, including instruments with fundamentals at B-flat, C, E-flat, and F. This does not change the key in which the tubists read; their parts should always be in concert pitch. Instead, they learn a new set of "fingerings" for each instrument. Note that this is opposite from how trumpets and horns approach transposition.
