## Instrumental Transpositions and Ranges

To write for transposing instruments, you first need to know how to read a transposing instrument.
Most transposing instruments sound down from the written pitch. 
To get an instrument to sound one pitch, you have to write the note transposed up. 

There are main 5 categories of transpositions:
1. C Instruments
2. Bb Instruments
3. Eb Instruments
4. F Instruments
5. Octave Instruments
- these are the most common, but there are instruments in D, G, E, Ab, etc. 

### Transpositions
#### Bb Instruments:

- Clarinet sounds in Bb.
  - If the written pitch is C, the clarinet will sound down to a Bb. 
  - To get a clarinet to play a C, the note on the page must be a D. 
  - The clarinet sounds a M2 down from the written pitch.

- Tenor Saxophone sounds in Bb plus an octave.
  - If the written pitch is a C, the tenor saxophone will sound a Bb down an octave (C4 = Bb2)
  - To get a tenor saxophone to play a C4, the note on the page must be a D5.
  - The tenor saxophone sounds a M9 down from the written pitch. 
  
#### Eb Instruments:

- Baritone Saxophone sounds in Eb plus an octave.
   - If the written pitch is a C, the bari sax will sound an Eb down an octave (C4 = Eb2)
  - To get a bari sax to play a C4, the note on the page must be an A5.
  - The bari sax sounds a M13 down from the written pitch.

#### F Instruments:

- English Horn sounds in F.
   - If the written pitch is a C, the english horn will sound down to an F.
  - To get an english horn to play a C4, the note on the page must be a G4.
  - The english horn sounds a P5 down from the written pitch.
  
### Shortcuts

- look for an instrument in concert pitch and transpose the other instruments to that key
- use solfege in each key to transfer it to a concert pitch score

### Sounding Pitch to Written Pitch

When working from a concert pitch score, transpose the opposite direction that you would if you were moving a transposed line to a concert line. 
- a Bb trumpet would be a M2 up to get to written pitch from sounding (concert) pitch
- everything goes in the opposite direction in the same interval

#### Brass Instruments

Brass instruments are strange.
A trombone is a Bb instrument due to its overtones, but it reads in C. 
Tuba also reads in C no matter the kind of tuba. 
The only brass that transposes are trumpets (Bb, C, A, etc...) and horns (F).
