title: Overview 4b - Compound Meters
---

Today's topic is the second classification of regular meters: *compound* meters.

As a quick review, there are a few critical terms necessary for discussing these meters. *Meter* is the manner in which we organize strong and weak pulses in music over time, and it is from this grouping that we determine the length of each *measure*. At its most basic, meter tells us two things:
- how we divide the meter into regular or irregular pulses called *beats*
- how many of these *beats* are in the measure

If we imagine meter as a hierarchy, *beats* are the highest level. Beats are then divided into *divisions*, and *divisions* can be further divided into *subdivisions*. A *regular* meter is one in which every *beat* is the same length.

Finally, do remember that meter is somewhat subjective and can be greatly altered by many factors, especially tempo. We will discuss this in the next topic, but where one listener might listen to a piece with four quarter-notes per measure and feel that the quarter notes are the beat, another listener may listen to the same piece and hear the beat in a slow two with the half-note as the beat.
