title: Overview 4c - Metric perception
---

Having just explored how changing the tempo of a piece written in 3/x can change the classfication between compound and simple, it should be no surprise that aural interpretation of meter is a subjective process. Many factors play a role in determining how a listener perceives a meter including tempo, accented beats, melodic patterns, and previously established "grooves". 

For example, listen to the first 20 seconds of the following clip of *Sintra* from Snarky Puppy's incredible collaboration with the Metropole Orkest.

By starting at this particular point in the piece, most listeners will hear this section in a slow, simple triple meter. But an observant student may have noticed the conductor in the background (around the 2:29 mark) conducting in a double-time three, which means that the conductor is placing an *off-beat* where the listener is likely hearing beat 2 of their slow simple triple meter. If we move our starting point backward by only ten seconds, we hear the original groove of this section of the tune, which is the origin of the double-time simple triple meter that we saw the conductor using.

By starting at this new point, many listeners will switch to a faster (double-time) simple triple meter. The listener may or may not carry this feel through the half-time section from the first clip, but given the conductor's beat pattern, we can be fairly certain that the orchestra is counting this section as if there is no change in meter. 

Perhaps even more interesting is the effect on the listener when we move our starting point back into the the intro of the piece.

The introduction is clearly in a slow compound quadruple meter. The melody happens mostly at the beat level, and the cellos have a constant arpeggio at the subdivision level. At the 1:20 mark, there is a slightly disconcerting two-beat transition, and then a new section starts that most listeners will hear as a continuation of the slow compound quadruple meter of the intro. This is reinforced by an ostinato in a contra-bass clarinet as well as the body language of the performers. When the trumpet and saxophone enter with a new melody at 1:32, we realize that this slow compound quadruple meter is the exact same feel and melody that we heard as a fast simple triple melody in the second clip.

The conclusion of this exercise should be that the listener's perception of meter is not tied to what is on the page, only to a complex array of aural input. Therefore, we can discuss meter in an objective manner by looking at what is written, but a listener is not required to hear the meter similarly to an analysis or even in the way in which the composer intended.
