Syncopation - create series of off-beats without a downbeat to demonstrate that what is written doesn't mean much unless the listener agrees and use this to find the a simple definition of syncopation

to show how tempo affects metric perception, reiterate 3/4 example and then demonstrate a 4/4 versus 2/2 feel.

For accented beats, use accents to switch a single-pitch, eighth note line between 3/4 and 6/8.

For melodic patterns, use arpeggios grouped into twos and threes to switch between 3/4 and 6/8

For all, discuss how it is difficult to switch between feels once one has been established. (First one wins for most people.) Maybe draw analogy to face/vase optical illusion?
