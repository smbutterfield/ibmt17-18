## Syncopation

*Syncopation* occurs when a note emphasizes the "weak" beats of a measure, but as discussed in Overview 4c, meter is based on perception and is therefore a subjective phenomenon. The very idea of strong and weak beats relies on a steady pulse to be established. Take the first three bars of the following example. Even though they are clearly written in a syncopated pattern that begins on the & of 1, most listeners would hear the first pitch as the downbeat because it is the first pitch they hear. However, when the top line is added in the fourth measure, it becomes easy to hear the bottom line as syncopated because a stronger reference has been established.

## Similar meters

The following two excerpts demonstrate how two variations -- melodic shape and accents -- can affect listener perception. Each example contains a rhythmic pattern scored in two different meters. Aurally, both parts will sound identical regardless of the meter, but when looking at the scoring, one of the two halves will likely stand out as matching your aural perception. Discuss the differences between the two ways of notating the examples and which one best reflects your perception of the excerpt. After you hit play, do not follow the part in order to allow your ear to determine how it hears the meter.

For melodic patterns, use arpeggios grouped into twos and threes to switch between 3/4 and 6/8

It should be noted that many composers rely on using meters to evoke particular rhythmic biases in the performer, so it is disingenuous that meter is entirely subjective. Stravinsky was well-known to write the same passage in various meters (e.g. *Rite of Spring*, *L'histoire du Soldat*)
