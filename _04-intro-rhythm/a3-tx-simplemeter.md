### Class Discussion

#### Meters

Simple meter:

- the top number in the time signature is divisible by 2

Top and bottom numbers in a time signature:

- the top number represents how many beats are in the measure.
- the bottom number tells you with what rhythmic quality represents the beat.
  - if a 4 is on the bottom, the beat is represented by a quarter note.
  - if an 8 is on the bottom, the beat is represented by an eighth note.
  
Duple, Triple, and Quadruple meter:

- duple meter: 2 
  - ex: 2/4, 2/2, 2/8, 2/16
- triple meter: 3
  - ex: 3/4, 3/2, 3/8, 3/16
- quadruple meter: 4
  - ex: 4/4, 4/2, 4/8, 4/16
  
*Ideal* beaming:

- shows where each beat occurs as an effort not to obscure the beat
  - half notes and whole notes are the exception
  - this applies more to eighth notes, sixteenth notes, and further divisions
  
**How you group a set of notes will make the reader's time easier or harder.** 

Common Meters:

- simple duple
- simple triple
- simple quadruple

Common beat-counting system:

- beats represented by numbers 
- simple division by *and*
- subdivision *1-e-&-a*

### Meters

Meter involves the way multiple pulse layers work together to organize music in time. Standard meters in Western music can be classified into *simple meters* and *compound meters*, as well as *duple*, *triple*, and *quadruple* meters. 

Duple, triple, and quadruple classifications result from the relationship between the counting pulse and the pulses that are *slower* than the counting pulse. In other words, it is a question of *grouping*: how many beats occur in each bar. If counting-pulse beats group into twos, we have duple meter; groups of three, triple meter; groups of four, quadruple meter. Conducting patterns are determined based on these classifications. 

Simple and compound classifications result from the relationship between the counting pulse and the pulses that are *faster* than the counting pulse. In other words, it is a question of *division*: does each beat divide into two equal parts, or three equal parts. Meters that divide the beat into two equal parts are *simple meters*.

There are three types of standard simple meters in Western music:

- simple duple (beats group into two, divide into two)
- simple triple (beats group into three, divide into two)
- simple quadruple (beats group into four, divide into two)

In a time signature, the *top number* (and the top number only!) describes the type of meter. Following are the top numbers that always correspond to each type of meter:

- simple duple: 2
- simple triple: 3
- simple quadruple: 4

## Notating meter

In *simple meters*, the bottom number of the time signature corresponds to the type of note corresponding to *a single beat*. If a simple meter is notated such that each quarter note corresponds to a beat, the bottom number of the time signature is 4. If a simple meter is notated such that each half note corresponds to a beat, the bottom number of the time signature is 2. If a simple meter is notated such that each eighth note corresponds to a beat, the bottom number of the time signature is 8. And so on. 

## Beaming

It's important to remember that notation is intended to be read by performers. You should always strive to make your notation as easy to interpret as possible. Part of this includes grouping the rhythms such that they convey the beat unit and the beat division. *Beams* are used to group any notes at the beat division level or shorter that fall within the same beat. 

In this example, the eighth notes are not grouped with beams, making it difficult to interpret the triple meter.

If we re-notate the above example so that the notes that fall within the same beat are grouped together with a beam, it makes the music much easier to read.

### Borrowed divisions ###

Typically, a meter is defined by the presence of a consistent beat division: division by two in simple meter, and by three in compound meter. Occasionally, composers will use a triple division of the beat in a simple meter, or a duple division of the beat in a compound meter. 

*Triplets* are borrowed from compound meter, and may occur at both the beat division and subdivision levels, as seen below.

Likewise, *duplets* can be imported from simple meter into a compound meter.
