### Compound Meter

measures: the separation of beats from one another based on the time signature

beat: pulse
 - there are strong and weak beats like there are strong and weak pulses
  
Regular Meters vs. Irregular Meters:
 
 - regular meters: every beat has the same division
  - ex: 4/4. Each quarter note can be broken up into 2 eighth notes.
 - irregular meters: beats within the measure that have different divisions of the beat
  - ex: 5/8. In a 2+3 5/8, the first beat is divided into 2 eighth notes, and the second beat is divided into 3 eighth notes.
  
Time Signature: 
- top number: number of beats in the measure
- bottom number: the note value held by the beat
  
Characteristics of compound meter:
- all beats are divisible by 3

Top and bottom numbers in a compound key signature:
- top number: how many divisions are in the meter
- bottom number: the rhythmic value of the division

Duple, Triple, and Quadruple:

In using the terms duple, triple, and quadruple, it refers to the number of strong beats. 
- duple has 2 strong beats with 3 eighth notes per beat
    - ex: 6/8
- triple has 3 strong beats with 3 eighth notes per beat
    - ex: 9/8
- quadruple has 4 strong beats with 3 eighth notes per beat
    - ex: 12/8
  
"Ideal" beaming in compound time:
- each beat is separated 
- similarly to simple meter, do not obscure the beat

Common compound meters:
- 6/8
- 9/8
- 12/8
- 3/8

Beat counting in compound time:
- 1 la li (# la li)

The key to meter is your perception when listening to it. 
Depending on the tempo, 3/4 is a time signature that can be classified as a simple triple, or a compound single. 
When the beat is in 3, it divides in two. 
When the beat came to the measure level, it makes the beat a 1 with a division of 3, insteadd of a 3 that can be divided by 2.

## From *Open Music Theory*

### Compound meters

Meters that divide the beat into three equal parts are *compound meters*. 

When combined with simple meters, there are six types of standard meter in Western music:

- simple duple (beats group into two, divide into two)
- simple triple (beats group into three, divide into two)
- simple quadruple (beats group into four, divide into two)
- compound duple (beats group into two, divide into three)
- compound triple (beats group into three, divide into three)
- compound quadruple (beats group into four, divide into three)

In a time signature, the *top number* (and the top number only!) describes the type of meter. Following are the top numbers that always correspond to each type of meter:

- simple duple: 2
- simple triple: 3
- simple quadruple: 4
- compound duple: 6
- compound triple: 9
- compound quadruple: 12

### Notating meter

In *compound meters*, the bottom number of the time signature corresponds to the type of note corresponding to *a single division of the beat*. If a compound meter is notated such that each dotted-quarter note corresponds to a beat, the eighth note is the division of the beat, and thus the bottom number of the time signature is 8. If a compound meter is notated such that each dotted-half note corresponds to a beat, the quarter note is the division of the beat, and thus the bottom number of the time signature is 4. Note that because the beat is divided into three in a compound meter, the beat is always three times as long as the division note, and *the beat is always dotted*.
