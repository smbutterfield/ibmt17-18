title: Lesson 4b - Compound Meters

## Class discussion

After a quick review of our general definitions from Overview, the class quickly worked through compound meters. *Compound meter* is a **regular** meter in which the beat is divided into three equal parts. This definition took a few tries to find its simplest form, because the students struggled to differentiate regular versus irregular meters. We will not be covering irregular meters until later in the course, so I asked them to consider the subjective nature of meters that will be discussed in the next topic, 4c - Metric Perception. After that discussion, we will see if this concept makes more sense.

For a *compound* time signature, the class suggested that:
- the top number is how many divisions are in the meter.
- the bottom number is the rhythmic value of the division.

These definitions actually took quite a few tries to reach. The students were somewhat careless with their use of the terms *beat, division*, and *subdivision*, but these three terms are the keys to separating compound from simple meters and their time signatures. In a simple meter, the top number is the number of *beats* in the measure, and the bottom number is the note value of the *beat*. Contrast that with compound meter time signatures. The top and bottom numbers represent entirely different concepts, and for compound meters, this requires a slight bit of math to find the actual number of beats. One student simplifed it to:
- To find the number of beats in a compound time signature, divide the top number by 3.

Of course, this highlights the primary problem with our time signature system. It requires the user to already understand the system by being able to differentiate between simple and compound meters, because the system is not uniform across all meters. This is why the pedagogical method of grouping meters by *simple* vs *compound* and then attaching a word to denote the number of beats (i.e. single, duple, triple, quadruple, etc.) is useful.

## Duple, Triple, and Quadruple:

The terms duple, triple, and quadruple refer to the number of beats in the measure. 
What is compound meter?

Compound meter is any time signature divisible by 3. 
This includes meters like 3/8, 6/8, 9/8, and 12/8. 
This excludes any meter in 5 or 7, no matter the division of the beat.

measures: the separation of beats from one another based on the time signature

beat: pulse
 - there are strong and weak beats like there are strong and weak pulses

Regular Meters vs. Irregular Meters:
 
 - regular meters: every beat has the same division
  - ex: 4/4. Each quarter note can be broken up into 2 eighth notes.
 - irregular meters: beats within the measure that have different divisions of the beat
  - ex: 5/8. In a 2+3 5/8, the first beat is divided into 2 eighth notes, and the second beat is divided into 3 eighth notes.
  
Time Signature: 
- top number: number of beats in the measure
- bottom number: the note value held by the beat
  
Characteristics of compound meter:
- all beats are divisible by 3

Top and bottom numbers in a compound key signature:
- top number: how many divisions are in the meter
- bottom number: the rhythmic value of the division

Duple, Triple, and Quadruple:

In using the terms duple, triple, and quadruple, it refers to the number of strong beats. 
- duple has 2 strong beats with 3 eighth notes per beat
    - ex: 6/8
- triple has 3 strong beats with 3 eighth notes per beat
    - ex: 9/8
- quadruple has 4 strong beats with 3 eighth notes per beat
    - ex: 12/8
 
 ## Differentiating between compound and simple meters

 The simplest method to differentiating 

## "Theoretically ideal" beaming in compound time

Like simple time, theoretically ideal beaming in compound time does not obscure beats. For whatever reason, compound time is written this way in common practice with only one notable exception. Occasionally a compound meter will create hemiola -- a sense of two against three -- by having three consecutive quarter notes. This figure will cover exactly two beats in compound time, and if written using quarter notes rather than tying two eighth notes together, this will obscure the second beat. The tune "America" from *West Side Story* highlights this rhythm as its primary melodic motif. 

Common compound meters:
- 6/8
- 9/8
- 12/8
- 3/8

Beat counting in compound time:
- 1 la li (# la li)

The key to meter is your perception when listening to it. 
Depending on the tempo, 3/4 is a time signature that can be classified as a simple triple, or a compound single. 
When the beat is in 3, it divides in two. 
When the beat came to the measure level, it makes the beat a 1 with a division of 3, instead of a 3 that can be divided by 2.

## From *Open Music Theory*

### Compound meters

Meters that divide the beat into three equal parts are *compound meters*. 

When combined with simple meters, there are six types of standard meter in Western music:

- simple duple (beats group into two, divide into two)
- simple triple (beats group into three, divide into two)
- simple quadruple (beats group into four, divide into two)
- compound duple (beats group into two, divide into three)
- compound triple (beats group into three, divide into three)
- compound quadruple (beats group into four, divide into three)

In a time signature, the *top number* (and the top number only!) describes the type of meter. Following are the top numbers that always correspond to each type of meter:

- simple duple: 2
- simple triple: 3
- simple quadruple: 4
- compound duple: 6
- compound triple: 9
- compound quadruple: 12

### Notating meter

In *compound meters*, the bottom number of the time signature corresponds to the type of note corresponding to *a single division of the beat*. If a compound meter is notated such that each dotted-quarter note corresponds to a beat, the eighth note is the division of the beat, and thus the bottom number of the time signature is 8. If a compound meter is notated such that each dotted-half note corresponds to a beat, the quarter note is the division of the beat, and thus the bottom number of the time signature is 4. Note that because the beat is divided into three in a compound meter, the beat is always three times as long as the division note, and *the beat is always dotted*.
