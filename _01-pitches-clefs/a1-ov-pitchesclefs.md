title: Overview 1a - Pitches and Clefs

## A Starting Place

Most college music students are familiar with basic music notation -- treble and bass clefs, staves, ledger lines, and accidentals. If you are comfortable with some aspect of these concepts, you can review the basics under the *Further Reading* section of [Lesson 1a]({{ site.baseurl }}/1ac-tx-pitchesclefs.html)

## Clefs

Even though most college music students are familiar with reading music, they are usually far more comfortable when working in the clef most associated with their primary instrument or voice-part. It is vital that musicians be fluent in not only these two most common clefs, but also with two additional clefs: alto clef and tenor clef. These clefs are commonly used for instruments such as viola, cello, trombone, and bassoon. Clefs are an essential way for a composer to communicate range while limiting ledger lines, so it is imperative that you become comfortable reading music in all of the most common clefs.

Treble clef is sometimes referred to as a *G-clef*, and bass clef can be called an *F-clef*.
Alto and tenor clefs are known as the *C-clefs*. 

## Goals for this topic

Use the examples on the next page to find:
- the order of pitch names for each clef's lines and spaces.
- why treble clef is a G-clef, why bass clef is an F-clef, and why alto and tenor clefs are C-clefs.
- any tips or tricks that may help in differentiating and reading clefs.
    - Hint: Many students begin their studies of clefs by relating the unfamiliar clefs to their most familiar clef.
