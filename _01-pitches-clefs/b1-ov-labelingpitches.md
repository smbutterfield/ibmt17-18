## Accidentals

This course assumes that you have a basic knowledge of how to raise and lower pitches in standard music notation. If you need to review proper usage of accidentals, please refer to the *Further Reading* section under [Lesson 1b]({{ site.baseurl }}/1b3-tx-labelingpitches.html).

## Labeling Octaves

When labeling pitches, we also need a way to refer to specific octaves or registers. We will be using the system used by the International Standard Organization (ISO). In this system, middle C is labeled as C4. 

## Enharmonic Equivalence

At its core, enharmonic equivalence is an easy concept: When two pitches sound the same -- meaning that they share identical wavelength frequencies -- but have different note names (i.e. letters), they are considered to be enharmonically equivalent. All pitches that are enharmonic equivalents create a *pitch-class*, so there are twelve possible pitch-classes. Every pitch has multiple enharmonic equivalents, but some are used less frequently due to the necessity for uncommon accidentals such as double-sharps and double-flats. Review the examples under Lesson 1b to make sure that you understand  the less common examples. Note that all but one pitch-class has at least three enharmonic equivalents when using the five most-common accidentals: *naturals, flats, sharps, double-flats, and double-sharps*. (The remaining pitch-class only has two possible enharmonic equivalents without creating accidentals that exist only in theory such as triple-sharps or triple-flats.)
