## Serialism and Tone Tows
Take the prime form (013).
- T0 = [0,1,3]
- T1 = [1,2,4]
- T2 = [2,3,5]
- T3 = [3,4,6]
- T4 = [4,5,7]
- T5 = [5,6,8]
- T6 = [6,7,9]
- T7 = [2,3,5]

The inversion is T0I = [9,e,0]
- T0I[0,1,3] = [9,e,0]
- T1I[0,1,3] = [t,0,1]
- T2I[0,1,3] = [e,1,2]
- T3I[0,1,3] = [0,2,3]
- T4I[0,1,3] = [1,3,4]
- T5I[0,1,3] = [2,4,5]
- T6I[0,1,3] = [3,5,6]
- T7I[0,1,3] = [4,6,7]
- T8I[0,1,3] = [5,7,8]
- T9I[0,1,3] = [6,8,9]
- TtI[0,1,3] = [7,9,t]
- TeI[0,1,3] = [8,t,e]

Common PC: a shared number between the left side of the T PC set and the right side of the TI PC set. 

What if we had all 12 pitch classes? 
The normal form both inverted and not would be [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,t,e].
But out of normal form, find the different options for starting points while maintaining all the same intervalic relationships between pitch classes. 
EX: (0,2,4,6,8,t,1,3,5,7,9,e)
To organize these pitches and their various transpositions and inversions, we have to build a tone row matrix. 
- a tone row matrix is a grid that lists all of our pitches and their intervalic relationships, representing all possible tone rows.

Building a tone row matrix involves comparing intervals to fill in a grid based on a tone row in a piece of serial music. 
Matrix row names:
- prime 
- inversion
- retrograde
- retrograde inversion
