Define serialism
Differentiate from 12-tone
Define a tone row

Show an aggregate and have class find its inversion
    First by interval for a row that doesn't start on zero
    Then by zeroing the row first

Matrix
    Fixed-zero vs movable zero
    Fixed-zero format
        Standard fixed zero vs prime fixed zero
        Changes how it looks, but doesn't affect naming which is why we use fixed zero instead of movable
        Greatly speeds up the matrix creation process
    Naming of retrograde and retrograde inversion rows is based on corresponding prime and inverted rows, NOT the starting pitch of the retro row
