## Common tone diminished chords
If you have a C chord, voiced C,G,E,G; and it moves to a series of pitches, voiced C,F#,D#,A. 
It moves back to the same voicing of C. 
- you could call it a D#o7, but it doesn't function as a viio7/iii because it doesn't move to the iii.
- you could call it an Ao7 if you respell two of the notes, but that's a #vio7, which isn't borrowed from any mode.

How does that use of pitches relate to the I chord?
It creates a diminished chord where all the pitches are tendency tones to the I chord, while carrying the tonic through it. 
In C, a common tone diminished chord is spelled C, D#, F#, A. 
That's a C (tonic) with a diminished chord on top (D#o).
- the common-tone is usually the root for voice leading reasons, but it doesn't have to be. 

Common-tone diminished chords have tonic function and serve to elongate the tonic function. 
It decorates a major I chord. 
These don't exist in minor. 
Ideally, the I chord exists on either side of the common-tone diminished chord (I - cto - I), but that doesn't always happen. 
- take the chord progression from the third example: V6/V - cto - V43/V. 
  - the cto is used to decorate the V/V with chromatic motion
    - you don't have to identify the chromatic tones as non-chord tones because you're classifying it as a common-tone diminished chord.
