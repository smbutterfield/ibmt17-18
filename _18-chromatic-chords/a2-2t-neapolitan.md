## Neapolitan 6 chord
A neapolitan 6 chord is a flat major II in first inversion. 
In C, spelled Db, F, Ab, but with F in the bass. 
Think ra, fa, le. 
It looks like a bII6 but is labeled N6. 

#### Example 
Given musical examples in major in minor, find the N6 chord and think about how it functions.

How does the N6 function?
- it is in first inversion
- functions as a pre-dominant
  - this is not like the modal interchange video
  - that was borrowed from phrygian and functioned as the dominant
  
What makes this different than the bII in the video?
