Neapolitan chord and augmented sixth chords act as functional substitutions for pre-dominant chords, although we looked at how they could be used to substitute for dominant chords as well. The chord that you will study below does not fulfill one of the three primary functions; instead, it is used to embellish and elongate a function. 

It is possible to think of this chord using tertian harmony, but its voice-leading determines its construction. 

Listen to and then analyze the following three progressions. The first is the most straightforward example of this chord, and each example gets progressively more difficult. As always, start your analysis with leadsheet symbols and then provide Roman numerals when possible. In each progression, study the chromatic chord to answer the following questions:
- How would you describe its construction?
- How does it function? (e.g. tonic, passing, etc.) 
- Does it have tendency tones, and if so, how do they resolve?
- If you were to compare it to a diatonic or chromatic chord that normally fulfills this function, which chord shares the most commonalities with it? 
- Does this embellishing chord work for all types of chords (i.e. major, minor, etc.)? If not, why?
