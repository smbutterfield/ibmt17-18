Just as you did with the Neapolitan chord, we can explore a new colorful chormatic chord, although this chord comes in multiple variants. (You can think of them as "flavors" if you'd like.) 

Analyze and listen to the following short progressions. There are two progressions -- one in major, one in the parallel minor -- for each of the three variants of this special chord. Start your analysis with leadsheet symbols and then provide Roman numerals if possible. In each progression, study the chromatic chord.
- How would you describe its construction? (Hint: Pay special attention to the scale degrees used in each chord.) 
- How does it function? (e.g. tonic, passing, etc.) 
- Does it have tendency tones, and if so, how do they resolve? 
- What do the three variants have in common and what differentiates each of them? 
- If you were to compare it to a diatonic or chromatic chord that normally fulfills this function, which chord shares the most commonalities with it? 
- Do they seem most "at home" in major or minor?
