The Neapolitan chord is a chromatic chord, but its construction is still based in tertian harmony. The chords that we will explore today are not so easily classified, although they are no more difficult to understand functionally. Interestingly, this chord comes in three different variants. (You can think of them as "flavors" if you'd like.) 

Analyze and listen to the following short progressions. There are two progressions -- one in major, one in the parallel minor -- for each of the three variants of this special chord. Start your analysis with leadsheet symbols and then provide Roman numerals if possible. In each progression, study the chromatic chord to answer the following questions:
- How would you describe its construction? (Hint: Pay special attention to the scale degrees.) 
- How does it function? (e.g. tonic, passing, etc.) 
- Does it have tendency tones, and if so, how do they resolve? 
- What do the three variants have in common and what differentiates each of them? 
- If you were to compare it to a diatonic or chromatic chord that normally fulfills this function, which chord shares the most commonalities with it? 
- Do they seem most "at home" in major or minor?

## Augmented sixth chords (<sup>+6</sup>)

The augmented sixth chords are collections of pitches that create smooth voice-leading. As such, they are not based in tertian harmony, so it is unhelpful to describe them using standard chord terms such as root, third, and fifth. Instead, we typically describe the chordal members by their scale degrees. In the table below, you can see that all augmented sixth chords share three common tones -- ^b6, ^1, and ^#4. The Italian variant consists of only these three pitches whereas the German and French variations have an added tone.

+6 variant | Chordal member | Chordal member | Chordal member | Chordal member | 
 --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Italian | ^b6 | ^#4 | ^1 | ^1 (doubled)
German | ^b6 | ^#4 | ^1 | ^b3
French | ^b6 | ^#4 | ^1 | ^2
