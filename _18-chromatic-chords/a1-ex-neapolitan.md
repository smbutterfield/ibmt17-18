In the modal interchange video from Unit 17b, you may have noticed that one of the progressions used a bII chord. In the same unit, we then looked at a similar usage of the bII in the excerpt from Mahler Symphony No. 2. In both cases the bII was acting as a functional substitution for a dominant function (or possibly a plagal cadential function). It shared many common tones with a vii<sup>o7</sup> chord, and these tendency tones followed the voice-leading resolutions that you would expect of a vii vii<sup>o7</sup>.

The bII is a commonly used chord, but its most common usage is not as a dominant function. Analyze and listen to the following short progressions. In each case, what function does the bII have? If you were to compare it to a different chord that normally fulfills that function, which chord is has the most commonalities with the bII? (Hint: Think about the inversion and choice of doubled notes.) Does it seem most "at home" in major or minor?
