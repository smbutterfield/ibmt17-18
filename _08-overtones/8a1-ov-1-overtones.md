The overtone series occurs naturally in non-synthetic tone production. When a person sings, the overtone series is present above every pitch. When any woodwind, string, or brass instrument creates a pitch, the overtone series is present above every pitch. Perhaps even more importantly for our discussions, the mathematics behind creating the overtone series are not only fascinating, but also explain the fundamentals of Western harmony 
- Why do we divide the octave into twelve parts?
    - The overtone series
- Why do we hear some intervals as consonant and others as dissonant?
    - The overtone series
- How do we determine if an interval is in tune?
    - The overtone series
- Why do we use a harmonic system based on perfect intervals and thirds?
    - The overtone series

To put it succinctly, the overtone series explains why music evolved as it did.

Before we look at an example of the overtone series, watch this wonderful video of Leonard Bernstein explaining how the overtone series explains harmony's evolution throughout the ages.
