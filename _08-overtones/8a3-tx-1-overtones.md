## The Overtone Series

The overtone series is a collection of pitches that exist within each pitch that give it its fundumental sound. 

The overtone series determines:
- intonation
- how brass instruments function
- explains why the octave is divided into 12 parts
- determines what we find consonant and dissonant
  - sooner vs. later in the overtone series: sooner is consonant, later is dissonant
- piano tuning

The pitch in which we base an overtone series is called the fundumental.
Every pitch after that is called an overtone.
The first pitch after the fundumental is called the first overtone, the next the second overtone, and on until you reach the eleventh overtone.
Overtones are also called partials. 
In the case of partials, there is no fundumental, but it is instead called the 1st partial.
Partials go up to the 12th partial.
Whether you refer to them as a fundumental and overtones or partials, there are the same 12 pitches.

### Intervals within the Overtone Series

The overtone series goes upwards in intervals. 
The intervals are based off of the fundumental. 
From the fundumental, you build the intervals P8-P5-P4-M3-m3-m3-M2. 
The last 4 pitches you build are a M2-M2-M2-m2. 
A more simple way to think of it is 8-5-4 3-3-3-2 2-2-2-2. 

The first 4 partials (fundumental and 3 overtones) are in the key of the tonic. 
The next 4 partials are in the key of the subdominant.
The last 4 partials are in the key of the dominant. 

For example, starting on C2, the overtone series would be C2-C3-G3-C4-E4-G4-Bb4-C5-D5-E5-F#5-G5.

The overtone series is also responsible for how music has progressed throughout history. 

### Soundwaves

The way we process octaves has to do with sound waves. 
In Western music, we tune in A440. 
An octave above that would be A880. 
That gives octaves a ratio of 2:1. 
As you move up the overtone series, the ratio gets smaller. 
The ratio from the 2nd to 3rd partial is 3:2.
The ratio from the 3rd to 4th partial is 4:3, and onward as you go up. 

### Real-Life Application
For vocalists, you can create overtones in your voice. 
When you hear a bass sustain an A, a soprano can sing a C# and it will have to align with his overtones to sound in tune. 
When you speak at a normal volume, your voice has overtones. 
If you speak in a hushed voice you're cutting out the overtones in your voice. 

- Equal temperment: a tuning system that allows for an instrument to play in all keys without having to retune. 

- Intonation: allows for notes to tune to each other.
  For vocalists to practice singing using only intonation, they can't use vibrato.
  They have to use straight tone. 
  
Applying the Overtone Series to part writing:
- use wider intervals at in the lower register
- use tighter intervals in the higher register
