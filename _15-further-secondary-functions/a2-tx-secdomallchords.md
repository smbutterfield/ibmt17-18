## More Secondary Dominant Functions
Any chord can have secondary function, not just dominants and leading-tones.

The V/IV in C is a C major chord. 
The only reason to label a C chord as V/IV is if the V is a V7. 
This makes a V7/IV, spelled CEGBb, or I7. 
BUT you will NEVER see a I7. 
It's function is the dominant of F, or the IV, so we write it as V7/IV. 
This is the same idea as the V/V being a II, but you will never write it as a II because that's not how it functions. 

### Secondary Dominant chords for functions other than Dominant
This can include:
- V/vi
- V/ii
- V/I (don't write)
- etc.

The chord guide chart has secondary function replacements for each chord.
Diatonic Harmony:
iii - vi - ii - V - I
Chromatic Harmony:
V/vi - V/ii - V/V - V/I - V/IV
- these can all be 7th chords as well
- in that case, the V/IV only functions as a 7th chord
- the V/V is included as a pre-dominant function
