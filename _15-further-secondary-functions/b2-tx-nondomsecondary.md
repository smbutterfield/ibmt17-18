## Non-dominant Function Secondary Chords

#### Example in C: Non-Secondary Dominant Functions (15b.)
What is the chord progression?
- we find chords that are unusual but still have secondary function

Progression: I -  V7 - x - x - x - V7 - I

Filled in:

C - G7 - Gm - A7/G - Dm/A - G7 - C

I - V7 - iv/ii - V42/ii - ii6/4 - V7 - I

### Harmonizing consecutive seventh chords

In a circle progression, stepwise resolution can be achieved with seventh chords in the iii and ii.
- iii43 - vi7 - ii43 - V7 - I

The second inversion in the iii7 and ii7 chords allows for a resolution with smooth voice leading

#### Example in C: Harmonizing Consecutive Seventh Chords

Soprano: C5 - B4 - C5 

Alto: F4 - F4 - E4

Tenor: A3 - G3 - G3

Bass: D3 - D3 - C3

Roman Numerals: ii7 - V43 - I 
- the third of the ii7 (F), instead of resolving down has to stay through the next chord to get to the E in the tonic

If you turn the ii7 into a V7/V, and change the F to an F# in the Alto line, you'll want to resolve it to a G.
That resolution, while melodically ideal, doesn't work for voicing the next chord. 
So sometimes you have to break voice leading rules. 

In the case of this example in a piece of music, the musician would rather read a Gb - F than an F# - F. 
This can cause confusion when trying to analyze a piece of music. 
Sometimes you have to think enharmonically to solve problems in analysis. 

#### Example in C: Consecutive Secondary Dominant Chords

Soprano: C5 - C5 - D5 - D5 - C5

Alto: E4 - E4 - F4 - G4 - E4 

Tenor: G3 - A3 - A3 - B3 - G3

Bass: C3 - A2 - D3 - G2 - C3

Roman Numerals: I - vi - ii - V - I
- here we have a normal circle progression

Where can we input secondary dominants?
Here are some places you can place secondary dominants.

(G) V/I = V (G), (D) V/V = ii (Dmin), (A) V/ii = vi (Amin), (E) V/vi = iii (Emin)
- you can replace every chord up to the V with a secondary dominant

Soprano: C5 - C#5 - D5 - D5 - C5

Alto: E4 - E4 - F#4 - G4 - E4 

Tenor: G3 - A3 - A3 - B3 - G3

Bass: C3 - A2 - D3 - G2 - C3

Roman Numerals: I - V/ii - V/V - V - I
- the secondary dominants are still resolving to the correct chord with a raised third
- this can give us a string of secondary dominants leading to V - I

iii - vi - [ii,IV] - [V,viio] - I

V/vi - V/ii - V/V - V - I

#### Example in C: Deceptive Resolutions of Secondary Dominant Functions

Soprano: C5 - B4 - A4 - G4 - G4

Alto: E4 - D4 - C4 - D4 - C4

Tenor: G3 - F#3 - A3 - D3 - C4 

Bass: C3 - E3 - F3 - F3 - E3

Roman Numerals: I - V7/vi - IV - V42 - I6

Why can the V7/vi go to the IV?
Because it creates a V - vi in the key of the vi, or a deceptive cadence in the key of A minor. 
That's why the progression sounds good to our ear. 
Why not label it V/vi - vi/vi?
It goes to a V in the real key right after the chord, so it is easier to see the IV - V than a vi/vi - V. 

Roman numeral analysis means labeling non-chord tones. 
Non-chord tones in the music we study will always fall into the categories we study. 
If the non-chord tone you label does not fall into one of the categories, you probably mis-labeled the chord tones. 

V/IV (C) - IV (F)
- labeling the C as a secondary dominant is pointless because it functions as the tonic, not as the dominant to IV. 

VII - III - VI
V/III - V/VI - VI
When they leave diatonic function, don't use a diatonic label. 
You aren't going to see a III7. 
You aren't going to see a II. 
They're written in other ways that make more functional sense.
