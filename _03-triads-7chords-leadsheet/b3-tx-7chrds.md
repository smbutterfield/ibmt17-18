### Class Discussion

#### Seventh Chords

A seventh chord is a chord with 4 pitches, as opposed to a triad with 3, or a diad with 2. 

There are 5 types of seventh chords:

- Major Major (MM)
- Major Minor (Mm)or Dominant 7th
- Minor Minor (mm)
- diminished minor (dm) or half diminished 
- diminished diminished (dd) or fully diminished

The first word is the triad quality (major triad), and the second word is the interval quality between the root and the 7th (M7). 

- Major Major: major triad + M7
- Major Minor (Dominant): major triad + m7
- Minor Minor: minor triad +m7
- Diminished Minor (Half-diminished): diminished triad + m7
- Diminished Diminished (Fully-diminished): diminished triad + d7

Intervals in all inversions:

- Root position: 7
- First Inversion: 6/5
- Second Inversion: 4/3
- Third Inversion: 4/2 

Figured Bass, Bass Position Symbols, Figures, and Inversion figures all represent the subscript numbers next to roman numerals.

#### Lead Sheet Notation

Lead sheet notation goes above the staff, and gives us the chord name and quality in order to spell the chord

- Major Triad: Bb
- Minor Triad: Bb-, Bbm, Bbmin
- Augmented Triad: Bb+, Bbaug
- Diminished Triad: Bbdim, Bbo

- Major Major Seventh Chord: Bbmaj7, BbM7
- Major Minor (Dominant) Seventh Chord: Bb7
- Minor Minor Seventh Chord: Bbm7, Bb-7, Bbmin7
- Diminished Minor (Half Diminished) Seventh Chord: Bbo/, Bbo/7
- Diminished Diminished (Fully Diminished) Seventh Chord: Bbo7

### From *Open Music Theory*

#### Seventh chords

A four-note chord whose pitch classes can be arranged as thirds is called a *seventh chord*.

Like with a triad, the pitch classes belonging to a seventh chord occupy adjacent positions (a four-pitch-class clump) on the circle of thirds. The four members of a seventh chord are the *root*, *third*, *fifth*, and *seventh*.

There are five qualities of seventh chords that appear in diatonic music: major seventh, dominant seventh, minor seventh, diminished seventh (also called fully-diminished), and half-diminished seventh. They are comprised of the following intervals above their roots:

-   major seventh: M3, P5, and M7 above the root (or major triad with a major seventh)
-   dominant seventh: M3, P5, and m7 above the root (or major triad with a minor seventh)
-   minor seventh: m3, P5, and m7 above the root (or minor triad with a minor seventh)
-   diminished seventh: m3, d5, and d7 above the root (or diminished triad with a diminished seventh)
-   half-diminished seventh: m3, d5, and m7 above the root (or diminished triad with a minor seventh)

Following are the lead-sheet abbreviations for seventh-chord qualities:

-   major seventh: maj7 or △7 (G<sup>maj7</sup> or G<sup>△7</sup>)
-   dominant seventh: 7 (B<sup>7</sup>)
-   minor seventh: m7 (F&#9839;<sup>m7</sup>)
-   diminished seventh: dim7 or °7 (D<sup>dim7</sup> or D<sup>°7</sup>)
-   half-diminished seventh: ⦰7 (A<sup>⦰7</sup>)
