title: Lesson 3c - Leadsheet Notation

### Class Discussion

The general naming system that we have used thus far allows us to talk about general categories of triads and seventh chords, but does not allow us to specify the exact root of a chord. Leadsheet notation is a shorthand method written above the staff that specifies a chord's root and quality. Leadsheet notation never had a centralized authority, so over many decades, it evolved various ways to denote the same chord qualities.

Leadsheet notation consists of a note name followed by a chord shorthand. The note name denotes the root of the chord, and is most commonly an upper-case letter regardless of the chord's quality. Some systems use a lower-case letter for minor chords, but this is less common and can become prolematic if the writer's penmanship is poor. For this course, please always use an upper-case root.

The chord quality shorthand can vary greatly, so we have listed the more common possibilites below for chords with a root of C. I have listed them in my order of preference -- again taking student penmanship into account. Clarity should be valued above brevity.

- Major Triad: C (no shorthand necessary, just a capital root name)
- Minor Triad: Cmin, Cm, C-
- Augmented Triad: Caug, C<sup>+</sup>
- Diminished Triad: Cdim, C<sup>o</sup>

- Major major (major seventh chord): Cmaj<sup>7</sup>, C<sup>M7</sup>, C<sup>&Delta;</sup>
- Major minor (dominant seventh chord): C<sup>7</sup>
- Minor minor (minor seventh chord): Cmin<sup>7</sup>, Cm<sup>7</sup>, C-<sup>7</sup>
- Diminished minor (half-diminished seventh chord): C<sup>&oslash;7</sup>, C<sup>&oslash;</sup>, Cmin<sup>7(&flat;5)</sup>
- Diminished diminished (fully-diminished seventh chord): Cdim<sup>7</sup>, C<sup>o7</sup>

## Inversions

We are also able to show chord inversions in leadsheet notation by using *slash-chords*. To use slashchords, you use standard standard leadsheet notation followed by a slash (/) and then the *bass* note. This allows you to show any inversion. For example:

C<sup>7</sup>/E is dominant seventh chord in first-inversion.

#### Lead-sheet symbols

A triad can be summed up by a single symbol, such as a lead-sheet chord symbol. A lead sheet symbol includes information about both root quality, as well as which pitch class occurs in the lowest voice (called the *bass* regardless of who is singing or playing that pitch).

A lead-sheet symbol begins with a capital letter (and, if necessary, an accidental) denoting the root of the chord. That letter is followed by information about a chord’s quality:

-   major triad: no quality symbol is added
-   minor triad: lower-case “m”
-   diminished triad: lower-case “dim” or a degree sign “°”
-   augmented triad: lower-case “aug” or a plus sign “+”

Finally, if a pitch class other than the chord root is the lowest note in the chord, a slash is added, followed by a capital letter denoting the pitch class in the bass (lowest) voice.

A C-major triad’s lead-sheet symbol is simply **C**. A C-minor triad is **Cm**. A D-sharp-diminished triad with an F-sharp in the bass is **D\#dim/F\#**. And so on.
