title: Overview 3c - Leadsheet Notation
---

In looking at triads and seventh chords, we have only learned how to label and classify these muiscal objects without specifying a particular root. A major triad or a dominant seventh chord can be built off any of the twelve pitch-classes, and each of the pitch-classes have multiple options depending on which enharmonic equivalent you choose as the root.  

There is one commonly-used method that we allows us to label specific triads and seventh chords as well as their inversions: *leadsheet notation*. This is also sometimes referred to as *slash-chord notation*, *jazz chord symbols*, or *pop chord symbols*. This system for labeling chords is prevalent in jazz and pop music but is extremely useful to all musicians because it creates a reliable way to communicate chords *of any complexity* in a concise manner.

Even after we introduce Roman numeral analysis and harmonic function in Unit 6,we will use leadsheet notation to provide a harmonic overview of complex analyses before we try to assign harmonic function and relationships. For example, if we have a C major triad and an F major triad and no other context, we cannot be sure what key this is. For those with a knowledge of diatonic function, it would seem most likely that these two chords belong to F major, but they could also exist diatonically in the keys of C major, D minor, A minor, as well as various modes. When analyzing harmonically ambiguous functions, it is critical to have a shorthand for labeling chords, so that we can look at the overview rather than re-analyzing each chord every time we come to a section of music.
