### Class Discussion

#### Keys 

We have 7 letter names because once you get to the 8th letter, it repeats itself. 
The 7th scale degree creates tonality in a diatonic scale. 

An octave relationship means that the wavelength is doubled in size. 
Octaves have a 2 to 1 ratio.

C - G - D - A - E - B - F# - C#

C - G - D - A - E - B - F - C

*If you lower the 7th letter it still rotates to a C letter in the circle of descending perfect fourths.*

Roman numberals are tied to function. 
20th Century Chord Symbols tell you the letter names. 

#### Triads

4 different qualities of triads:

- major 
- minor
- augmented
- diminished

Triadic Inversions:

- root position
  - the root of the chord is in the bass
- first inversion
  - the 3rd of the chord is in the bass
- second inversion
  - the 5th of the chord is in the bass

In a major triad, there are 4 different intervals, depending on the iversion: 3rds, 4ths, 5ths, and 6ths.

In root position, the 1st to the 3rd is a major 3rd, the 3rd to the 5th is a minor 3rd, and the root to the 5th is a perfect 5th.
In first inversion, the 3rd to the 5th is a minor 3rd, the 5th to the root is a perfect 4th, and the 3rd to the root is a minor 6th.
In second inversion, the 5th to the root is a perfect 4th, the root to the 3rd is a major 3rd, and the 5th to the 3rd is a major 6th. 

Chord members and qualities:

- 3rds determine major and minor (including perfect 5ths)
- 5ths determine diminished or augmented
   - diminished has a minor 3rd
   - augmented has a major 3rd
   
Tertian harmony: harmony in thirds

Root position triad intervals:

- Major: M3 + m3
- Minor: m3 + M3
- Diminished: m3 + m3
- Augmented: M3 + M3

Inversions are determined by the bass note. 

Inversion names:

- Root position: 5/3 
- First inversion: 6/3 (shortened to 6)
- Second inversion: 6/4

*The numbers are determined by the intervals from the lowest note to the other notes in the chord.*

Triad voicings:

- closed position uses simple intervals
  - in closed position the notes are as close together as possible
- open position uses compound intervals
  - open voicing is spread out
  - open position skips one of the voices

### From *Open Music Theory*

A chord is any combination of three or more pitch classes that sound simultaneously.

A three-note chord whose pitch classes can be arranged as thirds is called a *triad*.

<!--To tell whether or not a chord is a triad, take the pitch classes present in the chord. Assuming there are three pitch classes (not necessarily three *pitches*), arrange them on the circle of generic scale steps. (By generic, I mean that A-natural, A-flat, and A-sharp are all kinds of A.)

To quickly determine whether a three-note chord is a triad, arrange the three notes on the "circle of thirds" below. The pitch classes of a triad will always sit next to each other.

## Identifying and labeling triads ##

Triads are identified according to their *root* and *quality*.

### Triad roots ###

To find a triad’s root, arrange the pitch classes on a circle of thirds (mentally or on paper). The root is the *lowest* in the three-pitch-class clump. Expressed another way, if the circle *ascends* by thirds as it moves clockwise, the root is the “earliest” note (thinking like a literal clock), and the other pitch classes come “later.”

![A triad (A, C, E) on the diatonic circle of thirds.][circleOfThirds-triadRTF]

Once you know the root, you can identify the remaining notes as the *third* of the chord (a third above the root) and the *fifth* of the chord (a fifth above the root).

### Triad qualities ###

To find a triad’s quality, identify the interval between the root and the other members of the chord. There are four qualities of triads that appear in major and minor scales, each with their own characteristic intervals.

-   major triad: M3 and P5 above the root (as in *do–mi–sol*)
-   minor triad: m3 and P5 above the root (as in *do–me–sol* or *la–do–mi*)
-   diminished triad: m3 and d5 above the root (as in *ti–re–fa*)
-   augmented triad: M3 and A5 above the root (as in *me–sol–ti*)

## Building a triad ##

To build a triad on the staff, identify the root, quality, and bass note from the lead-sheet symbol. The root and quality will tell you what three pitch classes belong to the triad. For example, **C<sup>+</sup>** tells you the root is C, and the quality is augmented. Since the quality is augmented, there is a major third above the root (E) and an augmented fifth above the root (G-sharp). Since there is no bass note appended to the lead-sheet symbol, the bass note is the same as the root: C. Write a C on the staff (in any comfortable register), then write the other chord tones (E and G-sharp) *above* the C (see the Caug triad in the above figure).

For **Cm/E&#9837;**, the root is C, and the quality is minor. Since the quality is minor, there is a minor third above the root (E-flat) and a perfect fifth above the root (G). The slash identifies E-flat as the bass note. Write the E-flat on the staff. Then write a C and a G above it to complete the chord (again, see above).

When all the members of the triad are as close to the bass note as they can be, the chord is in what is called *close position* (C, Cm/E&#9837;, and Cdim/G&#9837; above). When there are spaces between chord tones, the chord is in *open position* (Caug above). (In certain musical situations, only one of those positions will be useful or desirable.)

## Listening to triads ##

Each triad quality has its own distinct sound, and to an extent that sound is preserved even when the chord is *inverted* (when the pitch classes are arranged so that a pitch class other than the root is in the lowest voice). As you practice identifying and writing triads, be sure to play the triads, both to check your analysis/writing and to develop the ability to identify chord qualities quickly by ear.
