## Class Discussion

### Scales

A scale is a particular collection of half steps and whole steps. 
A pitch collection can be any number or arrangement of pitches. 

  - you can have 4 pitches in a pitch collection
  - you can have 11 pitches in a pitch collection

**A scale is a collection of pitches, but pitch collections are not necessarily scales.**

A scale is centralized around a tonic. 
Pitch collection is an umbrella term that *can* include scales.

What is the hierarchy of scale degrees and why?

1. Tonic 
2. Supertonic
3. Mediant
4. Subdominant
5. Dominant
6. Submediant
7. Leading Tone (in a major key)

  - if the 7th scale degree is a half step from the tonic, it is always called the Leading Tone
  
G major and G minor are in the same key.
If two scales share the same tonic, they are modes of each other, thus mode mixture. 

Melodic minor has ascending and descending versions so it can pull to the tonic. 
Removing La and Ti takes away important functionality.

If you can hear where tonic is, you can fina any other pitch. 

Pentatonic Scales:

  - if you spend a lot of time in major pentatonic, La starts to have a pull toward the tonic in the absence of Ti.
  - if you spend a lot of time in minor pentatonic, Te starts to have a pull toward the tonic in the absence of Ti.
  
- Li and Te may be enharmonically equivalent, but they function completely differently from each other

#### Key Signatures

When adding sharps to a key, it adds a sharp to the 7th scale degree, creating Ti. 
When adding flats to a key, it adds a flat to the 4th scale degree, creating Fa. 

The placement of Fa and Ti on the 7th scale degree (creating a 7 diminished chord) creates the whole of tonality for the key because it is Ti and Fa that pulls toward the tonic.

## From *Open Music Theory*

When you're writing in a single key for an extended period of time, it gets tedious to write out the accidentals over and over again. 

Here is a simple melody in D major, without a key signature.

To avoid this, composers used *key signatures* at the beginning of each staff to remind performers of which pitch classes should have flats or sharps. 

Here is the same melody, with the key signature at the beginning of the staff to remind the performer that F and C should be sharp.

### The circle of fifths

The circle of fifths is an illustration that has been used in music theory pedagogy for hundreds of years. It conveniently summarizes the key signature needed for any key with up to seven flats or sharps.

But *which* notes are flat or sharp in a key? To properly use the circle of fifths to figure out a key signature, you'll need to also remember this mnemonic device, which tells you the order of flats and sharps:

**F**ather **C**harles **G**oes **D**own **A**nd **E**nds **B**attle. 

For sharp keys (clockwise on the circle of fifths), read the mnemonic device forward. For example, the circle of fifths tells us that there are 3 sharps in the key of A major. Which three notes are sharp? The first three notes in the mnemonic device: F(ather), C(harles), and G(oes). 

For flat keys (counter-clockwise on the circle of fifths), read the mnemonic device backwards. For example, the circle of fifths tells us that the key of A-flat major has four flats. Which flats? Reading backwards: B(attle), E(nds), A(nd), D(own). 

### Minor key signatures ###

Of course, minor keys can use key signatures, too. In fact, for each major key signature, there is a corresponding minor key that shares its signature. Major and minor keys that share the same key signature are called *relative* keys. For example, both C major and A minor have zero sharps or flats. A minor is considered the *relative minor* of C major; likewise, C major is considered the *relative major* of A minor. Compare the minor key circle of fifths below with the major key circle of fifths above, and you'll see the remaining relative key pairs.

### Writing key signatures ###

Below is a reference that shows how all of the key signatures should be written on treble, alto, tenor, and bass clefs.
