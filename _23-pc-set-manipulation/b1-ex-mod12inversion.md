title: 23b Examples - PC Set Inversion

Transposition is the most commonly used set manipulation, but there is a second commonly used function that is of equal importance to understanding pc sets.

## Inversion

When first studying tonal harmony, we discussed the scale degree names in pairs: dominant/subdominant, mediant/submediant, subtonic/supertonic. For each of these pairs, there is a duality to their naming in that they share a relationship centered around the tonic pitch. For example, the dominant is a P5 *above* the tonic where the subdominant is a P5 *below* the tonic. They are mirrored around the central pitch, and therefore represent an *inversion* of each other.

There are a variety of parameters that can be used to establish inversion relationships in music, but in set theory, we do this based around intervals (i.e. numbers of half-steps). Look at the following number continuum. To find an inversion of a pitch class, you need two pieces of information: the pitch class to be inverted and the pitch class on which you will center the inversion.
