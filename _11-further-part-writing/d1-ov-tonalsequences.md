title: 11d Overview - Tonal Sequences
---

A sequence occurs when a musical pattern is established then repeated at a repeated transposition. Sequences can be any combination of the following categories:
- melodic, harmonic, or both
- ascending or descending
- diatonic or chromatic
- single or multiple parts within each repeated segment

Sequences work because they rely on one of the most fundamental human characteristics: our ability to identify patterns. All music relies on a listener's familiarity with the tendencies within a style, but these tendencies can be broken if a composer is able to create a new pattern to guide the listener. Once a musical pattern is established, it will sound "right" to a listener, even if this pattern defies standard tonal conventions.
