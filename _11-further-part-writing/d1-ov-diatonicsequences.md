title: 11d Overview - Diatonic Sequences
---

A sequence occurs when a muiscal pattern is established then repeated. Sequences can be any combination of the following categories:
- melodic, harmonic, or both
- ascending or descending
- diatonic or chromatic
- single or multiple parts within each repeated segment

We have already studied some sequences in previous units, even though we did not call them such at that time, and we will be looking at how these shaped tonal harmony in the examples on the next page.
