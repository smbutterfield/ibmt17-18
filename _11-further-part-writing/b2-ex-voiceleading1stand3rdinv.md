## Function over form (Part 2)

**When harmonizing the short chord progressions in the previous topic, we discussed why we have to treat the vi chord in a deceptive cadence as a *functional substitute* for tonic. Because the vi chord as a replacement for a I chord, we double the scale degree that works best for a I chord, `do`, rather than the standard doubling of the root, `la` or fifth, `mi`. In this progression, it is correct to break standard convention and double the chordal third of the vi chord. Now that we are looking at first inversion voice-leading, we have two more *functional substitutions* to discuss.**
- IV is a pre-dominant, so therefore functions as a ii<sup>7</sup> chord without its root
- vii<sup>o</sup> is a dominant function, so therefore functions as V<sup>7</sup> chord without its root
- When V goes to vi, the vi chord is replacing the tonic function and therefore functions as a I<sup>sub6</sup>

**This means that the IV chord and vii<sup>o</sup> chord must be follow different *doubling* rules in order to avoid poor voice-leading. Also, when a V chord precedes a vi chord, the vi chord must follow different *doubling* rules in order to avoid poor voice-leading. With this in mind, harmonize the following progressions; first as the primary functions (i.e. V<sup>7</sup>, ii<sup>7</sup>, and I) and then by substituting in the functional substitution (i.e. vii<sup>o</sup> IV, and vi respectively.)**
