## Resolving tendency tones

**Placing either the chordal third or chordal seventh in the bass voice not only creates more melodic bass lines, it also allows the upper voices more freedom because there is one less tendency tone to distribute. Use the voicing and voice-leading guidelines discussed in the previous topic to harmonize the following progressions in an SATB style. As always, make note of any difficulties that you encounter for the class discussion.**

**Assuming that the progression follows the circle-of-fifths, what does the a first- or third-inversion chord require of the following chord's inversion?**

## Function over form (Part 2)

**When harmonizing the short chord progressions in the previous topic, we discussed why we have to treat the vi chord in a deceptive cadence as a *functional substitute* for tonic. Because the vi chord acts as a replacement for a I chord, we double the scale degree that works best for a I chord, `do`, rather than the standard doubling of the root, `la` or fifth, `mi`. In this progression, it is correct to break standard convention and double the chordal third of the vi chord. Now that we are looking at first inversion voice-leading, we have another *functional substitution* to discuss.**
- vii<sup>o</sup> is a dominant function, so therefore functions as V<sup>7</sup> chord without its root

**Because of this, the vii<sup>o</sup> chord must follow different *doubling* rules in order to avoid poor voice-leading. With this in mind, harmonize the following progressions; first as the primary function (i.e. V<sup>7</sup>) and then by using that to inform your doubling on the functional substitution (i.e. vii<sup>o</sup>).**

**As a general rule of thumb, any diminished chord (including the ii<sup>o</sup> in minor) will typically need to have the chordal third doubled, because the tension of the diminished fifth and its tendency tones.**

## Function over form (Part 3)

**The pre-dominant function can be confusing. To this point, we have considered the circle-of-fifths as the voice-leading foundation for diatonic harmony. In this case, the ii chord would be the "primary" pre-dominant function, and in many ways, this is true. The IV chord, however, holds a special place in harmony because of its role as the *subdominant*, and the high frequency throughout history of the I-IV-V-I progression.**

**Generally speaking, a root position ii chord and root position IV chords are equally strong and follow standard doubling conventions. When the ii chord goes to the first inversion however, the IV chord should be considered the primary pre-dominant with the ii chord acting as its *functional substitution*. This means that a ii<sup>6</sup> chord takes its doubling from a root-position IV chord. Try this on the following progressions. Remember what the upper voices tend to do when a root position IV chord moves to a V chord.**
