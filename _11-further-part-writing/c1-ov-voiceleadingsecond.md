title: Overview 11c - Voice-leading for Second Inversion Chords
---

In diatonic harmony, second inversion chords cannot be used as their normal diatonic functions. For example, a I<sup>6/4</sup> will never function as the tonic in a cadence. Instead, second inversion triads introduce four alternate functions:
- cadential
- passing
- pedal
- arpeggiated

For each of these functions, the chord will be extending the function -- tonic, dominant, pre-dominant -- of another chord rather than defining its own.
