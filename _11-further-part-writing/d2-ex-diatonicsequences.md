## Melodic sequences

**We will begin studying sequences by looking at melodic sequences because they demonstrate the basic principles without the complications of multiple voices. Look at the following melodic patterns; each one is the beginning of a melodic sequence. Complete the pattern through the designated ending pitch and then discuss the repetition using the following terms:**
- ascending or descending
- diatonic or chromatic
- repeated intervals
- length of pattern
- single or multiple parts within each repetition
