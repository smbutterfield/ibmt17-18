# Class Discussion

Further to our discussion of the importance of patterns in music, please view the following TED Talk by Dr. Scott Rickard. He used mathematics to try to create music without any repetition, and the results are...interesting.

## Melodic sequences

As the class worked through creating the melodic sequences, I realized that I needed to clarify that the pattern itself does *not* need to be defined. When we are describing sequence, we assume that the reader is looking at the music and therefore can see the entire first iteration. Instead, we focus our description on **how the pattern is transposed**, not on describing the intervals within the initial segment.

Once this was clear, easily incorporated the terms in their description of the pattern.
- **Diatonic patterns** only use notes within the key signature so they do not require a quality when discussing the transpostion. For example, you cannot say, "This pattern is transposed in ascending major 3rds," because diatonic patterns will have a mix of major 3rds and minor 3rds depending on which scale degrees the transposition starts. Instead, we would say, "This pattern is transposed in diatonic ascending 3rds," because this tells the reader to go up a 3rd and use whatever note is in the key signature.
- Conversely, **chromatic patterns** *do* require a quality on the transposition for the interval, because the pattern repeats *exactly* using the same intervals from the initial iteration. 

Example:
1. What is the melodic pattern?
  - 3 notes up stepwise and the 4th note stepwise down
2. Is it diatonic or chromatic?
  - diatonic
3. How does the pattern move?
  - up stepwise between pattern segments
 
When you identify that a pattern is diatonic, you don't need to specify intrval quality because the structure is in the key and changes quality as it progresses. 
Chromatic patterns have fixed intervalic qualities. 
Patterns can be described in different ways that can all be correct. 
 
### Parts of Sequences
1. Ascending or descending
2. Diatonic or chromatic
3. Intervals of transposition
4. Length of pattern
5. Single or multiple parts within each repitition

#### Two-Voice Sequence

Ex: Harmonize a two-voice sequence
Upper line: C5 - F5___F5 - E5___E5 - D5___D5 - C5___C5 - B4 - C5
Lower line: C3 - A3 - G3 - G3 - F3 - F3 - E3 - E3 - D3 - D3 - C3
Roman Numerals: I - IV6 - V7 - I6/4 - IVM7 - viio6/4 - iii7 - vi6/4 - ii7 - V6/4 - I

- the underscores indicate tied notes
- the tied notes are a string of 7-6 suspensions
- once you establish a pattern in the chord progression you have to stick with it for the sequence to work
- the sequence in this progression is a string of 6/4's and 7th chords
- it is also a series of descending diatonic 5ths
