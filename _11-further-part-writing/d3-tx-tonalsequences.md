## Diatonic Sequences

Sequences: a repeated segment of music.

Example of patternless music:
TED Talk "The world's ugliest music" by Scott Rickard.

- a way of understanding the most basic structure of music
- a definable pattern
  - our brains love repetition

### Types of Sequences:
1. Melodic
2. Harmonic
3. Diatonic
4. Chromatic

#### Melodic Sequences:
- a repeated segment of melody
  - you can break diatonic harmony in the melody as long as it is a part of the pattern
  - the new pattern becomes the function of that portion of music

Class Activity: Finish the melodic pattern.

Example:
1. What is the melodic pattern?
  - 3 notes up stepwise and the 4th note stepwise down
2. Is it diatonic or chromatic?
  - diatonic
3. How does the pattern move?
  - up stepwise between pattern segments
 
When you identify that a pattern is diatonic, you don't need to specify intrval quality because the structure is in the key and changes quality as it progresses. 
Chromatic patterns have fixed intervalic qualities. 
Patterns can be described in different ways that can all be correct. 
 
### Parts of Sequences
1. Ascending or descending
2. Diatonic or chromatic
3. Intervals of transposition
4. Length of pattern
5. Single or multiple parts within each repitition

#### Two-Voice Sequence

Ex: Harmonize a two-voice sequence
Upper line: C5 - F5___F5 - E5___E5 - D5___D5 - C5___C5 - B4 - C5
Lower line: C3 - A3 - G3 - G3 - F3 - F3 - E3 - E3 - D3 - D3 - C3
Roman Numerals: I - IV6 - V7 - I6/4 - IVM7 - viio6/4 - iii7 - vi6/4 - ii7 - V6/4 - I

- the underscores indicate tied notes
- the tied notes are a string of 7-6 suspensions
- once you establish a pattern in the chord progression you have to stick with it for the sequence to work
- the sequence in this progression is a string of 6/4's and 7th chords
- it is also a series of descending diatonic 5ths
