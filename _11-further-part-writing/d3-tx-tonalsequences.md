## Diatonic Sequences

Sequences: a repeated segment of music.

Example of patternless music:
TED Talk "The world's ugliest music" by Scott Rickard.

- a way of understanding the most basic structure of music
- a definable pattern
  - our brains love repetition

### Types of Sequences:
1. Melodic
2. Harmonic
3. Diatonic
4. Chromatic

#### Melodic Sequences:
- a repeated segment of melody
  - you can break diatonic harmony in the melody as long as it is a part of the pattern
  - the new pattern becomes the function of that portion of music

Class Activity: Finish the melodic pattern.

Example:
1. What is the melodic pattern?
  - 3 notes up stepwise and the 4th note stepwise down
2. Is it diatonic or chromatic?
  - diatonic
3. How does the pattern move?
  - up stepwise between pattern segments
 
When you identify that a pattern is diatonic, you don't need to specify intrval quality because the structure is in the key and changes quality as it progresses. 
Chromatic patterns have fixed intervalic qualities.
