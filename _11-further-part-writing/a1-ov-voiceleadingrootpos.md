title: Overview 11a - Voice-leading for Root Position Triads and Seventh Chords
---

We can view the voicing rules (i.e. spacing, range, doubling, and voice-crossing) as our guidelines for creating the vertical aspect of this style of music, and our voice-leading rules (i.e. tendency tones, conjunct lines, and avoiding part-writing errors) as guidelines for creating the horizontal aspect of this style of music.

When composing in this style, you occasionally will need to bend, or even break, these rules to accommodate other musical goals. There is not a "right" or "wrong" hierarchy when part-writing. For example, avoiding parallel perfect 5ths may be acceptable if you are trying to create a particular voicing. Voice-crossing of the inner voices can be used to change the timbre and texture of a passage.
