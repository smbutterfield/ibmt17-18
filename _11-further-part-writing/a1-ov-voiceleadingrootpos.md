title: Overview 11a - Voice-leading for Root Position Triads and Seventh Chords
---

We can view the voicing rules (i.e. spacing, range, doubling, and voice-crossing) as our guidelines for creating the vertical aspect of this style of music, and our voice-leading rules (i.e. tendency tones, conjunct lines, and avoiding errors) as guidelines for creating the horizontal aspect of this style of music.

When composing in this style, you occasionally will need to bend, or even break, these rules to accommodate other musical goals. As we look at the rest of the part-writing errors on the next page, remember to treat each of these as a means to an end rather than the entirety of the goal.
