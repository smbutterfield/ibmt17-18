## Voice-Leading for First and Third Inversion Chords 

First inversion chords make tendancy tones the top priority.
First inversion chords put the chordal third in the bass, which locks you in to resolving the bass line a cetrain way. 

The third wants to resolve down to the root of the next chord. 
The seventh wants to resolve down to the third of the next chord. 

First inversion triads want to resolve to the next chord in root position. 
Third inversion seventh chords want to resolve to a first inversion of the next chord. 

Example: 

Lead Sheet: C - G/B - C - C - G7/F - C/E

Soprano: C5 - D5 - C5 - C5 - D5 - C5

Alto: E4 - F4 - E4 - E4 - G4 - G4

Tenor: G3 - G3 - G3 - G3 - B3 - C4

Bass: C3 - B2 - C3 - C3 - F3 - E3

Roman Numerals: I - V6/5 - I - I - V4/2 - I6

First and third inversion chords are meant to make the bassline more melodic and enjoyable to sing. 

### VII Diminished Chords

Your ear hears it as either wanting to resolve inward by halfstep or outward by halfstep depending on what you hear.
If you hear a tritone as an augmented 4th, it wants to resolve outward.
If you hear a tritone as a diminished 5th, it wants to resolve inward.

VII Diminished chords (viio) do not double the root in 4-part voicing. 
  - both Ti's will want to resolve to Doh 
    - that creates part writing errors
    
If you're ever questioning your doubling in a viio, think of how you would voice the chord if it were a V7.
