## Cadential 6/4s

**A cadential 6/4 chord is the most straightforward usage of second inversion chord, because it has the most specific rules.**
- It occurs when a I<sup>6/4</sup> chord precedes a *root-position* V chord. It cannot move to an inversion of a V chord.
- The I<sup>6/4</sup> loses its tonic function and instead gains a dominant function. You can consider it an extension/anticipation of the arrival of the dominant chord.
- It can resolve to either a V or V<sup>7</sup> chord.
- It always occurs as part of the cadence for a phrase, hence the name.

**Harmonize the following three examples to see how well the voice-leading works for a cadential 6/4 chord.**

**Cadential 6/4 chords are often used to correct part-writing difficulties in apparoaching the V chord. Look at the third progression that you just harmonized. If the cadential 6/4 were removed, it would in parallel perfect 5ths between the soprano and bass.**

**Some theory methods teach that a cadential 6/4 should not be labeled as a I<sup>6/4</sup>; instead, they label it as a V<sup>6/4 - 5/3</sup>. The reasoning behind this is twofold:**
- The I chord does not have a tonic function.
- The cadential 6/4 often strongly resembles a 4-3 suspension and a 6/5 suspension occurring at the same time.

**These are both certainly good reasons and enforce an understanding of the true nature of the cadential 6/4. I prefer to label it as a I<sup>6/4</sup> chord, however, because:**
- We do not use Roman numerals like this in other instance, so it creates an unnecessary exception for students to learn and often confuses students on the difference between inversion figures and actual figured bass.
- Students often confuse a cadential 6/4 with a true V<sup>6/4</sup>, a chord that occurs regularly as a passing chord. (Read more on this below under the passing chord section.)
- When looking at an analysis, we are required to understand that all 6/4 chords function in one of the four alternate categories (i.e. passing, cadential, passing, and arpeggiated), but we do not create special Roman numeral cases for any of the others. Students are more than capable of learning the other three usages of second inversion chords, and they can remember that a I<sup>6/4</sup> followed by a root-position V chord is a cadential 6/4.

## Passing 6/4s - function over form (Part 4)

**Passing chords are the second standard usage for second inversion chords,and they function identically to the description of how first and third inversion chords are used as passing chords. It is a second-inversion chord inserted between two other chords to create a bass line with stepwise motion. You consider *passing* a function that replaces a chord's standard function (i.e. tonic, dominant,and predominant), and instead extends the function of the chords on either side. Harmonize the following example to see how vii<sup>o</sup>

**Passing 6/4 chords also provide further clarity as to why vii<sup>o</sup> As we explored when studying first inversion chords (Unit 11b), we discussed two important ideas regarding vii<sup>o</sup> chords:**
- The vii<sup>o</sup> is a functional substitution for the V<sup>7</sup> chord and therefore takes its voice-leading and doubling conventions from a rootless V<sup>7</sup> chord.
- The vii<sup>o6</sup> is often employed as a passing chord between I and I<sup>6</sup> to create a bass line with stepwise motion.

**This explains why a vii<sup>o6</sup> chord functions as a passing chord; it is actually substituting for a passing V<sup>6/4</sup> chord. Harmonize the following two progressions to see how similar these two chords are.**

{% include abc-example.html number="3" abc=ex3 %}

**When harmonizing the short chord progressions in the previous topic, we discussed why we have to treat the vi chord in a deceptive cadence as a *functional substitute* for tonic. Because the vi chord acts as a replacement for a I chord, we double the scale degree that works best for a I chord, `do`, rather than the standard doubling of the root, `la` or fifth, `mi`. In this progression, it is correct to break standard convention and double the chordal third of the vi chord. Now that we are looking at first inversion voice-leading, we have two more *functional substitutions* to discuss.**
- IV is a pre-dominant, so therefore functions as a ii<sup>7</sup> chord without its root
- vii<sup>o</sup> is a dominant function, so therefore functions as V<sup>7</sup> chord without its root
- When V goes to vi, the vi chord is replacing the tonic function and therefore functions as a I<sup>sub6</sup>
