## Voice-Leading for Second Inversion Chords

Second inversion chords have the most rules when it comes to part writing. 
To exist in a progression, they have to be used for one of 4 functions:
1. Cadential
2. Passing
3. Pedal
4. Arpeggiated

A I6/4 chord is close to functioning in the same way as the V. 
It has the most static motion in a movement to the V. 

### Cadential Motion

The Cadential 6/4 uses a I6/4 as an extention of the dominant leading to a cadence. 
Progression: I - IV - I6/4 - V - I. 
- doubling the 5th in the I6/4 makes it an extention of the V as it leads to I
- must go from a I6/4 to a root position V or V7

#### Example: In C

Lead Sheet: C - F - C/G - G

Soprano: C5 - C5 - C5 - D5

Alto: E4 - F4 - E4 - G4

Tenor: G3 - A3 - G3 - B3

Bass: C3 - F2 - G2 - G2

Roman Numerals: I - IV - I6/4 - V

Without the cadential 6/4, we would have parallel perfect fifths in the soprano and alto voices between the IV and the V.
The cadential 6/4 avoids this problem by sticking a I6/4 in between the two chords as an extention of the dominant.
