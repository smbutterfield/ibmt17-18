    - 37.4.(1)-(3)
        - For question (1), use pc *integer* notation for all three blanks.
        - For question (2), only answer the first of the three questions. (i.e. How many set classes...?)
        - Question (3) is asking you to relate the letter before the `=` to the letter after the `=`. It is confusingly written because T stands for transposition and I represents inversion, but they are just mixed with the letters (A-J) from question (1). For example, E = T_ C is asking you find the transpositional relationship between (e) and (c) from question (1). There are two possible answers for all of these, one positive and one negative. You will receive credit for either.
        - Do not complete question (4).
