title: Inquiry-Based Music Theory
---

*Inquiry-Based Music Theory* is an [open-source]({{ site.github-repo }}), interactive, online textbook for college-level music theory courses written and designed by Sean Butterfield and Evan Williamson.
It was developed with support of the [Think Open Fellowship](https://open.lib.uidaho.edu/) from the University of Idaho. 
The project was inspired by and partially adapted from [*Open Music Theory*](http://openmusictheory.com/).

The textbook is designed to maximize flexibility and support an inquiry-based model of instruction. 
For a simple explanation of this model as well as how to best utilize this textbook's structure, please view [About this textbook]({{ site.baseurl }}/about.html).

If you are already familiar with the inquiry-based model, you can begin exploring the textbook using the side bar navigation or by browsing the [Table of contents]({{ site.baseurl }}/toc.html).

IBMT makes use of [abcjs](https://github.com/paulrosen/abcjs) to present interactive musical examples throughout the text. 
Checkout the [ABC Tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/abc-tutorial.html) to get started with ABC Notation. *Note: the full functionality of abcjs works best on up-to-date Chrome or Firefox browsers.*
