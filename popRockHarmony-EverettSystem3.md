title: Pop/rock tonality with modal borrowing
---

Some pop/rock songs exhibit tonality that strongly resembles common-practice classical harmony, but which borrows from diatonic modes. In other words, it is a kind of hybrid between Everett's System 1 (common-practice classical) and System 2 (based on diatonic modes). Since it is such a simply "system" of borrowing, two examples will suffice.

Radiohead's "Everything in its Right Place" mixes elements of major-key tonality and Aeolian mode. While the introduction could be considered an example of [System 5](popRockHarmony-EverettSystem5.html) (major triads built on members of the minor-pentatonic scale), the verse clearly clearly combines a major tonic triad with **v**, **flat-VI**, and **flat-VII** borrowed from Aeolian.

The Rolling Stones' "Brown Sugar" is firmly in a major key, largely built on **I**, **IV**, and **V**, but regularly borrows from Aeolian for its **flat-VI flat-VII I** progression, heard clearly at the end of the instrumental introduction.
