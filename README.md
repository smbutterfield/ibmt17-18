# Inquiry-Based Music Theory OER

*Inquiry-Based Music Theory* is an open-source, interactive, online textbook for college-level music theory courses written and designed by Sean Butterfield and Evan Williamson.
It was developed with support of the [Think Open Fellowship](https://open.lib.uidaho.edu/) from the University of Idaho. 
The project was inspired by and partially adapted from [*Open Music Theory*](http://openmusictheory.com/).
