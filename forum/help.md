title: IBMT Forum Help
---

The [IBMT forum]({{ site.baseurl }}/forum/test.html) is added to this site using the [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) community platform service.
This is a public forum intended to help students learn, communicate, and collaborate around IBMT.

Get started by logging into Disqus using a Facebook, Twitter, Google, or Disqus account. 
In this setting, it is often better to use a non-personal account to keep your academic discussion separate from your personal social media.
We suggest creating a Disqus account to avoid sharing your personal social media details.

Please remember the forum is public!
