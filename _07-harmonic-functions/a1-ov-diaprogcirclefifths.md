title: Overview 7a - Diatonic Progressions Derived from Circle-of-fifths Voice-leading
---

As shown in the basic two-part examples in 6b, the progession from V to I creates a strong and natural sense of resolution. Why do these two chords work so well?

There are many reasons, but there are voice-leading tendencies between these progressions that pull strongly toward each other. As we discussed in Unit 2c, diatonic scales are a collection of whole steps and half-steps, and it is the insertion of the half-steps into the circle-of-fifths that create diatonic collections out of the chromatic collection. If you study the examples on the next page, you will see that these half-step resolutions are also the foundation of voice-leading in diatonic progressions. If you understand the voice-leading principles that pull the V chord into the I chord, you can then extend these rules to create the basic progression on which all diatonic harmony evolves from.

Of note, the significance of cultural conditioning cannot be overlooked. Any person raised around a style of music will be conditioned to hear certain tendencies as a natural progression, and this holds true for anyone raised around music descended from the diatonic tradition. This does not change the importance of voice-leading in forming these progressions, but it is worth remembering the difference between laws, rules, and strategies discussed in the first reading from Unit 6.
