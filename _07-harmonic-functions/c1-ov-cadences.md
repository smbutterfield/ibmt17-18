title: Overview 7c - Cadences
---

Music is often compared to language, and nowhere is that comparison more apt than in studying how phrases end. If a musical phrase is equivalent to a sentence, then the *cadence* is the period at the end of the sentence. All cadences finish a phrase, but not all cadence provide closure and stability. In fact, some cadences are purposefully unsettled.

We will study the chords associated with classifying cadences, but it takes far more than a particular harmonic progression to create a cadence. In addition to chord progressions, cadences are affected by melodic shapes,melodic rhythm, harmonic rhythm, contextual clues, meter, and many other elements of music.

For this course, we will study six types of cadences:
- *perfect authentic cadence*
- *imperfect authentic cadence*
- *half cadence*
- *deceptive cadence*
- *plagal cadence*
- *phrygian cadence*
