# Class discussion

Upper voices cannot be more than an octave apart from each other. 
The soprano voice cannot be more than an octave apart from the alto voice, and the alto voice cannot be more than an octave apart from the tenor voice.
The bass voice can go wherever it wants. 
Voice crossing is generally frowned upon.

Previously, you had learned which scale degree wants to resolve to another scale degree.
BUT, in the context of chordal harmony, those rules don't always apply. 
One of the most common chord progressions we hear in popular music is IV - V - I. 
Often times the bassline will move Fa - Sol - Do. 
That bassline breaks the tentancy that Fa wants to move to Mi. 

Instead, you have to think what chordal members resolve to other chordal members. 

Circle of Fifths Progression:
- chordal movement along the circle of fifths

#### Observations of Chordal Movement

In a circle of fifths progressions:
- the 7th of one chord resolves to the 3rd of the next chord
- the third of the chord resolves to the root of the next chord
- in root position, the bass voice wants the root to resolve to the root of the next chord

Including the ii chord in a V - I progression:
- ii - V - I

How would you voice the ii chord to smoothly lead to the V (in C)?
- middle line D in the bass to move to a G
- D in the tenor to stay at a D
- F in the alto to move to a G
- A in the soprano to move to a B

How would you voice the vi chord to smoothly lead to the ii (in C)?
- top line A in the bass to move to a D
- C in the tenor to move to a D
- E in the alto to move to a F
- A in the soprano to stay on an A

How would you voice the iii chord to smoothly lead to the vi (in C)?
- third space E in the bass to move to an A
- B in the tenor to move to a C
- E in the alto to stay on an E
- G in the soprano to move to an A

You've just created a circle of fifths progression.
  
  I - iii - vi - ii - V - I 

We also find that IV and viio function the same way as two other chords.
The IV can also function as a ii, and the viio can also function as the V.

  I - iii - vi - [ii/IV] - [V/viio] - I

The circle of fifths is where tonality comes from.
Not only is it built into our overtone system, but it is how we hear harmony. 

Common exceptions:
- V can go to vi (in the use of a cadence)
- iii can go to IV (rarely)
- IV can go to I (in the use of a cadence)

In minor:

i - III - VI - [iio/iv] - [V/viio] - i

- the same exceptions in chordal movement that apply to major also apply to minor

## From *Open Music Theory*

Analyzing harmony in a piece or passage of music involves more than labeling chords. Even the most basic analysis also involves *interpreting* the way that specific chords and progressions function within a broader context. Ultimately, no analysis is complete until individual musical elements are interpreted in light of the work as a whole and the historical setting in which the piece occurs. But this resource simply walks through the steps of performing a basic harmonic analysis, interpreting each chord and chord progression in light of the musical phrase in which it occurs.

The first step in a harmonic analysis is to *identify phrases*. For the most part, that means beginning by identifying *cadences*. However, not every type of phrase ends with a cadence, so sensitivity to theme types is important. In classical instrumental music, that means listening for [period- and sentence-like structures](classicalThemes.html). In Classical or Romantic music with text, that means listening in particular for the ends of poetic lines and melodic phrases.

Once you have identified the musical phrases, it can be helpful to perform a harmonic reduction (thoroughbass reduction, for example) for each phrase. Below the score/thoroughbass line, write the appropriate Roman numeral, **T/S/D** label for each chord, and/or an uninterpreted functional bass symbol for each chord (**T1 T3 S4** etc.). [This handout]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Handouts/HarmoniesByBassScaleDegree.pdf) can help you determine the functions of chords in the thoroughbass reduction.

Next identify the general harmonic structure of each phrase. Typical phrases in classical music will do one of the following:

- prolong tonic without a cadence (a classical *presentation* phrase, for example)  
- progress toward an authentic cadence (ending with **V<sup>(7)</sup> I**, **D5 T1** in functional bass)  
- progress toward a half cadence (ending with **V**, **D5** in functional bass)

If the phrase prolongs tonic (no cadence), label the *entire* phrase **T–––.**

If the phrase ends with a cadence, identify the *cadential progression*. This includes the last chord of the tonic zone, optionally followed by a subdominant chord or zone (most often a single chord), and a required dominant zone (most often a single chord or compound cadence formula). Half-cadence phrases end there. Authentic-cadence phrases continue on to a final tonic zone (usually a single chord). 

The the **(P) D T** of the cadential progression should be labeled as such. Once the cadential progression is identified, everything before it is labeled as tonic prolongation. Regardless of whether it is contrapuntal prolongation, a subsidiary progression, or a combination of the two, it will be labeled **T–––.** (See [Harmonic syntax – prolongation](http://openmusictheory.com/harmonicSyntax2.html) if those terms are unfamiliar to you.)

Thus a phrase ending with a half cadence will have a functional analysis that looks like:

> T—————— (P) D 

A phrase ending with an authentic cadence will have a functional analysis that looks like:

> T—————— (P) D T

Following is an excerpt from the opening of Haydn's Piano Sonata in C Major, Hob. HVI:21, I. Chords are labeled with Roman numerals and a **T/S/D** functional label for each chord. The tonic prolongation is shown below that with a T followed by a line for the duration of the tonic zone. The cadential progression is comprised of the last tonic chord (m. 4) through **S D T** to the **PAC** in m. 6.

*Harmonic syntax* concerns the norms or principles according to which harmonies (chords) are placed into meaningful successions. These norms include progressions that are more or less common than others. Those norms generate expectations for listeners familiar with the style: if **IV–V** is more common than **IV–VI**, the appearance of a **IV** chord generates an expectation that the next chord is more likely to be **V** than it is to be **VI**.

In Western classical music, harmonies generally group into three *harmonic functions* — tonic (T), subdominant (S), and dominant (D) — and these functions group together chords that progress to and from other chords in similar ways. For example, since **II** and **IV** are both subdominant chords, they will participate in many of the same kinds of chord progressions, and at times can be substituted for each other with only a minimal change to the musical effect.

On a local level (chord-to-chord progressions), we can summarize the tendencies of these functions with the cycle **T–S–D–T**. That is, harmonies tend to progress through a cyclical progression of those three functions:

> **T → S → D → T →** and so on . . .

That does not rule out T progressing to D, D progressing to S, etc. But it does mean that those progressions tend to be less common, at least in classical music.

Higher-level musical structures also impact the norms according to which these harmonic functions progress. For now, we will consider one higher-level structure that influences chord-progression tendencies — the phrase — and we will limit our study to isolated, complete, self-sufficient phrases. This is an idealized, oversimplified setting — like strict voice-leading — that is useful for learning the basics. Some such phrases even exist in real music! But most of the time there are a number of competing factors that influence the chord-progression strategies employed by a composer at any given moment. However, the idealized phrase is a helpful starting point. Future study will explore how classical composers employ harmonic progressions in larger musical works that combine multiple phrases (which are not self-sufficient) into larger themes and movements.


## The idealized phrase

The *idealized phrase* (also called the *phrase model*) is a single musical phrase that progresses through an entire cycle of harmonic functions, beginning and ending on tonic. (Strict voice-leading exercises are such phrases.) These phrases begin with a point of stability (tonic), move away from that stable point, and then eventually lead to a point of high tension and resolution (an *authentic cadence*). This pattern of stability–instability–stability, or rest–motion–rest, with a single goal at the end, should be familiar both from species counterpoint and from strict keyboard-style voice-leading. (This pattern also governs large-scale formal structures in classical music.)

The simplest phrase that exhibits this complete harmonic cycle is a tonic-dominant-tonic progression: **I–V–I.** This phrase begins and ends with the most stable harmony (**I**), and includes an *authentic cadence* (**V–I**). The **V** is the high point of instability, containing the tendency tone (*ti*) that most strongly points to the final point of arrival (*do*, or tonic).

This harmonic cycle can be expanded by inserting a subdominant chord, a destabilized tonic chord, or both, as in the following examples: 

> **I IV V I**  
> **I II V I**  
> **I VI V I**  
> **I VI II V I**

In *functional bass* terms, any harmonic progression that follows the pattern

> **T1 → (S_) → D5 → T1**

can serve as the basis for a complete idealized phrase. (Harmonies in parentheses are optional.)

Phrases are seldom 3–5 chords long, however, and a harmonic function can be expressed by more than a single chord. Thus we can understand the harmonic functions not simply as chords, but as *zones* of varying length in a phrase, which can be created by a number of chords or short chord progressions. More generally, then, our idealized musical phrase contains a single progression of functional zones **T → (S) → D → T**, begins with **T1**, and ends with an authentic cadence (**D5–T1**), as seen in the example below.


## Triggering and prolonging harmonic functions in an idealized phrase

To establish, or trigger, a harmonic functional zone, composers tend to use *a fixed scale degree in the bass*. In other words, tonic tends to be triggered by **T1** (always **I**), subdominant by **S2** or **S4** (including a variety of **II** and **IV** chords, in in root position or inversions, with and without sevenths), and dominant by **D5** (**V**, with or without a seventh, or a [*compound cadence*](cadenceTypes)). These four categories of chords — **T1**, **S2**, **S4**, and **D5** — are called *functional chords* (because they trigger the function) or *cadential chords* (because they can participate in a cadence). 

Other chords are often called *contrapuntal chords* or *embellishing chords*, and are typically used to *prolong* a function throughout the zone. 

Functional prolongations are shown in a harmonic analysis by writing/typing T, S, or D underneath the individual chord labels (Roman numerals or functional bass) and extending a line from the beginning of the functional zone to the end.

The following excerpt is from Mozart's Piano Sonata in A Major, K. 331, I., mm. 1–4, with a harmonic reduction and analysis provided below the original score. Such an analysis is called an *interpreted* harmonic analysis, because the harmonies are interpreted according to the way they behave in the phrase, rather than merely labeled. In this phrase, note the following:

- The tonic zone is triggered by a root-position tonic triad (**I** or **T1**).  
- Contrapuntal dominant chords (**D7** — first-inversion dominant chords) create a passing bass motion between the opening **I** chord, the **vi** in m. 3, and the return of **I** in m. 4.  
- The [cadential progression](harmonicAnalysis) begins in m. 4 with the move from **I** to <strong>ii<sup>6</sup></strong> (**S4**) and then to the cadential six-four and dominant triad (**D5**). Note that the entirety of the cadential progression in m. 4 is made up of *cadential chords* — chords with fixed scale degrees in the bass.  
- In contrast, the entire tonic-prolongation zone is made up of *contrapuntal chords* — variable scale degrees in the bass — with the exception of the **I** chord that triggered the tonic function.  
- The **vi** chord is a root-position chord, but still an embellishing chord, while the <strong>ii<sup>6</sup></strong> is an inverted chord, but still a functional/cadential chord. The difference is not the inversion, but the scale degree of the bass.

Not all classical phrases as neatly fit the general trends outlined in this resource. As discussed in [Style and tendency](tendency), the principles of harmonic syntax are both reliable and bendable/breakable, and it is often the music that bends/breaks the "rules" in interesting ways that we care about the most. So in your own analyses, keep these principles in mind as *general* principles, and simultaneously look for where composers meet these expectations as well as where they break them.
