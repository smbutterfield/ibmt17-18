title: Overview 7c - Performing a Harmonic Analysis
---

using standard progresions to determine whether a note is an NCT or not
use C major triad with A-B above it in eight notes
  which is the NCT?
  create two settings, one where the A is the passing tone, the other where the B is the passing tone
   

## From *Open Music Theory*

If a musical function describes the role that a particular musical element plays in the creation of a larger musical unit, then *a harmonic function describes the role that a particular chord plays in the creating of a larger harmonic progression*. Each chord tends to occur in some musical situations more than others, to progress to some chords more than others. These tendencies work together to create meaningful harmonic progressions, which can in turn form the harmonic foundation for musical *phrases*, *themes*, and larger formal units.

Generally speaking, the function of a chord concerns the notes that belong to it (its *internal characteristics*), the chords that tend to precede and follow it, and where it tends to be employed in the course of a musical phrase.

A theory of harmonic functions is based on three fundamental principles:

- Chords are collections of scale degrees.  
- Each scale degree has its own tendencies.  
- The collective tendencies of a chord's scale degrees in combination is the chord's function.

(Note the absence of *root* and *quality* from consideration here.)

Because [tendency is style-specific]({{ site.baseurl }}/06-intro-harmonic/1-reading-styletendency.html), the same chord can have different functions in different musical styles. For instance, the kinds of functions we find in classical music are different from those we find in pop/rock songs from the Billboard charts. And though there are some general harmonic traits that are common to most eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Western composers (what we call the "common practice"), when we look in closer detail, we find some significant differences in the way Bach, Mozart, Brahms, and others compose their harmonic progressions.

Our initial exploration of harmonic functions will engage the general "common practice" that is shared by most eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Western composers. As we explore specific genres, composers, and works within that common practice, we will have opportunity to explore the more nuanced differences between composers, as well as to move beyond common-practice Western art music to include other styles, such as pop/rock.
