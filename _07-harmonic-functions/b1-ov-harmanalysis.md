make the point that this is the most useful tool in determining whether a note is an NCT or not, and this is the fundamental crux of analysis: how do we determine what we hear when there is a subjective element

Now that we see how circle-of-fifths progressions within a key create a basic harmonic "outline", we can use that pattern to begin analyzing harmony.The framework from these progressions provide can be used to help us to organize any piece of music in this tradition. This allows us to ask the two fundamental questions of all harmonic analysis: 
- How are expectations created in the music?
- Which pitches are functional to these expectations and which pitches are embellishment?

Regardless of the complexity or era of a composition, if a theorist can answer these questions about a piece, they can analyze the fundamental qualities of the music.

As discussed in Overview 6b, diatonic harmony divides harmonic function into three basic categories: tonic, dominant, and pre-dominant function. These three functions are based around the circle-of-fifths voice-leading discussed in the previous topic.
