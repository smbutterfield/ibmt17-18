Kostka-Payne circle-of-fifths chart
make the point that this is the most useful tool in determining whether a note is an NCT or not, and this is the fundamental crux of analysis: how do we determine what we hear when there is a subjective element

Now that we see how circle-of-fifths progressions within a key create a basic harmonic "outline", we can use that pattern to begin analyzing harmony. The framework that these progressions provide can be used to help organize any piece of music in this tradition and allows us to ask the two fundamental questions of all harmonic analysis: 
- How are expectations created in the music?
- Which pitches are functional in creating these expectations?
  - (Bonus question) Consequently, are all the other pitches just embellishing the functional pitches?

Regardless of the complexity or era of a composition, if a theorist can answer these questions about a piece, they can analyze the fundamental qualities of the music.
