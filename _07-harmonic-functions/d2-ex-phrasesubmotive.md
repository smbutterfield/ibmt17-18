title: 7d Examples - The Phrase, Sub-phrase, and Motive
abc: true
---

Now that you have a basic understanding of harmonic progressions, harmonic function, labeling function with Roman numerals, and cadences, you can combine these ideas to explore musical phrases. 
- After listening to Mozart's *An Die Freude* multiple times (found below), mark the beginning and ending of each phrase based on your listening. 
    - Remember that each phrase should sound like a complete musical idea with a clear beginning, middle, and end.
- Once you have established these, label the last two chords of each phrase using Roman numerals and inversion figures.
- Do each of your phrase endings fit one of the cadences discussed in Unit 7c? If so, label the cadence below the Roman numerals.
- Identify at least one motive and describe what are defining characteristics of the motive. Rhythm? Specific intervals? Repeated progressions?
- Find multiple iterations of your motive. How does Mozart transform it throughout the piece?
- Once you have completed each of these steps, discuss what you think defines a phrase. What are the essential components?

Because this piece only has two voices, many chords will have more than one option for a harmony, so you must use the harmonic flowchart from the beginning of this chapter to choose the most likely harmony based on function. For example, if a harmony only has `mi` and `sol`, this could be either a I chord or a iii chord. If you put it into context, however, it will become clear what harmony the listener is likely to hear. If the harmony with `mi` and `sol` is preceded by `fa` and `sol`, it is highly unlikely that this is a iii chord. `fa` and `sol` outline a V<sup>7</sup> harmony, and a V chord will not resolve to a iii chord. Instead the listener will hear this as a V chord resolving to a I chord -- albeit an unstable I chord.

Also note that this piece has multiple modulations that I have marked into the score. We will cover modulations in a later unit, but for now, make sure to analyze each phrase ending in the correct key. If you do not, your cadences will not make sense.
