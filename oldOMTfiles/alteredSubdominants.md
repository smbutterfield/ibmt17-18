title: Chromatically altered subdominant chords
---

The most common chromatically altered subdominant chords (aside from the applied dominant of V) are the *Neapolitan chord* and the various *augmented-sixth chords*.

## Neapolitan chord

The Neapolitan chord contains lowered scale-degree 2, along with scale-degree 4, and lowered scale-degree 6: *ra*, *fa*, and *le*. It is a major triad, and it usually appears with *fa* in the bass (first-inversion), which is also doubled in a four-voice texture. 

In a Roman numeral analysis, **N.** (or **N.<sup>6</sup>**) substitutes for a Roman numeral (that is, it is not labeled a flat-II chord in classical music). As a chromatically altered subdominant chord, it always expresses subominant function (**S**).

In a functional bass analysis, **N.** is placed below the functional designation of **[S4]**.

Several prominent Neapolitan chords occur in "Der Müller und der Bach" from Schubert's song cycle, *Die schöne Müllerin* (song no. 19). On the score below (mm. 7–10 of the song), the tonic triad (G minor) is followed by a Neapolitan, then a dominant-seventh chord, and then tonic: T – S – D – T.

## Augmented-sixth chords

Augmented-sixth chords are so named because of the augmented sixth that occurs between *le* and *fi*, two scale-degrees that are present in every augmented-sixth chord. The other pitch(es) in the chord determine which kind of augmented-sixth chord is present. 

### Italian augmented-sixth chord

The *Italian augmented-sixth chord* is the simplest augmented-sixth chord, with only three members: *le*, *do*, and *fi*. *Le* is typically the bass note, and in a four-voice texture, *do* is typically the pitch that is doubled. (Keep in mind that you do not double the bass in a chord of the sixth, nor a chromatically altered tone such as *fi*. Thus, *do* remains as the only tone that can be doubled in strict style, and this doubling typically carries into freer styles, as well.)

In a Roman numeral analysis, **It.** replaces a Roman numeral. The figured bass is a simple slashed "6." It expresses subdominant function **S**).

When *le* occurs in the bass, the functional-bass designation is **[S6]**. Under that functional bass symbol, we also label the chord **It.**

The following example is from Beethoven's Bagatelle, Op. 119, No. 1, mm. 1–4. In m. 3, the Italian augmented-sixth chord falls on beat 3, immediately before the dominant chord.

### French augmented-sixth chord

The *French augmented-sixth chord* has four members: *le*, *do*, *re*, and *fi*. As in the Italian sixth, *le* is typically the bass note.

In a Roman numeral analysis, **Fr.** replaces a Roman numeral. The figured bass is a slashed "6" with a "4" and a "3." It expresses subdominant function **S**).

When *le* occurs in the bass, the functional-bass designation is **[S6]**. Under that functional bass symbol, we also label the chord **Fr.**

The following example is from Mozart's String Quartet, "Dissonance," K. 465, iv., mm. 10–16. The French augmented-sixth chord occurs on beat 2 of m. 14. In this passage, a "milder" subdominant chord (**IV<sup>6</sup>**) progresses to the more intense French sixth, which progresses into the cadential 6/4 before the final **V–I.**

### German augmented-sixth chord

The *German augmented-sixth chord* has four members: *le*, *do*, *me*, and *fi*. As in the other augmented sixth chords, *le* is typically the bass note.

In a Roman numeral analysis, **Ger.** replaces a Roman numeral. The figured bass is a slashed "6" with a "5." It expresses subdominant function **S**).

When *le* occurs in the bass, the functional-bass designation is **[S6]**. Under that functional bass symbol, we also label the chord **Ger.**

The German sixth is almost always used in minor and followed by a cadential 6/4 chord, with *me* and *do* carrying over into the cadential 6/4. 

In Beethoven's Piano Sonata in E Major, Op. 109, iii., a German augmented-sixth chord occurs on the last beat of m. 7 and carries over into m. 8 before releasing tension into the half cadence at the end of m. 8.

### Swiss augmented-sixth chord

The *Swiss augmented-sixth chord* has four members: *le*, *do*, *ri*, and *fi*. This chord is named "Swiss" because it sounds German but is spelled like the French. (*ri* in place of *me*) (Switzerland has a mixture of German-, French-, Italian-, and Romansch-based languages, with German and French being the largest.) *Le* is typically the bass note.

In a Roman numeral analysis, **Sw.** replaces a Roman numeral. The figured bass is a slashed "6" with a slashed "4" and a "3." It expresses subdominant function **S**).

When *le* occurs in the bass, the functional-bass designation is **[S6]**. Under that functional bass symbol, we also label the chord **Sw.**

Like the German sixth, the Swiss augmented-sixth is almost always followed by a cadential 6/4 chord. However, the Swiss chord tends to appear in major keys, with *ri* proceeding to *mi* and *do* carrying over into the cadential 6/4.
