title: Harmonic functions in minor
---

In classical harmony, usually the same chords are used in major and in minor with the same functions. For example, **T1 S4 D5 T1** (**I IV**-or-**II V I**) is common in both modes, though the quality of chords will change. In rock/pop music, especially that of the last 20 years or so, there are some common differences in the normative harmonic patterns of major and minor modes.

For instance, the most common **S–D** progression in major is **IV–V**. While this is also common in minor, there is another common **S–D** progression that is far more common in minor than major: **bVI–bVII**. Thus the typical cadential bass line of *fa*–*sol*–*do* is replaced by *le*–*te*–*do*. In other words, **Dm–E(m)–Am** is replaced by **F–G–Am**.

Where minor-key songs with **IV–V–I** bear a stronger resemblance to their *parallel* major (sharing the same bass syllables and Roman numerals), songs that employ this **bVI–bVII–I** progression bear a stronger resemblance to the *relative* major (sharing the same bass notes and actual chords). 

For example, the common **S–D–T** progression in C major is **F–G–C**. In A minor, the same functional progression could be **F–G–Am**.

Songwriters like U2 (“One”) take advantage of this relationship in songs where the verse and chorus modules are in different keys. In both cases, the verse is in minor and is based on a chord progression that ends **bVI–bVII**, followed by a return to **I** at the beginning of the next phrase. In both cases, the chorus begins on **I** in the relative major, turning the **bVI–bVII** in the minor key into **IV–V** in the major key. This two-key approach with **VI–VII / IV–V** as “pivot” point has become increasingly common in recent years.
