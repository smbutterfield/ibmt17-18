title: Form in pop/rock music – Analytical notation
---

Following are notational conventions for analyses of musical form.

## Capital letters

Modules are labeled with capital letters according to function. A module that functions as a strophe is labeled with an “A”; a module that functions as a bridge, “B”; etc.

## Lower-case letters

Phrases are labeled with lower-case letters according to their musical content. If two phrases use more-or-less the same musical framework (harmony, melody, and rhythm), they receive the same letter. Letters are assigned in the same manner as poetic rhymes: the first phrase is *a* and any phrase that follows based on the same music is also *a* (primes are used for slight variations, such as new text or altered instrumentation); the next phrase with new musical material is b; and so on. These letters do *not* correspond to functions. 

The single exception to this convention is when phrases within a module demonstrate a sentential progression (*srdc*), in which case the first phrase (statement) is labeled *s*; restatement/response, *r*; departure, *d*; conclusion, *c*.

## Full-sized numerals

Full-sized numerals are attached to capital letters when there are two or more modules with the same function but different music. For example, if a song contains two different melodies that both function as verse themes, they are labeled “V1” (the one that appears first in the song) and “V2.”

## Subscript numerals

Subscript numerals are attached to capital letters when there are two or more modules with the same function and music but different text. For example, if a song contains three verses, and they all have different lyrics but the same music, they are labeled “V<sub>1</sub>”, “V<sub>2</sub>”, and “V<sub>3</sub>”.

## Timeline notation

[Variations Audio Timeliner][VAT] does not support subscripts. It is fine to use full-sized numerals for both purposes if making timelines in VAT.
