title: The Pachelbel progression 
---

**&#124;&#124;: I – V – VI – III – IV – I – IV – V :&#124;&#124;**

The Pachelbel progression comes from ‘Canon’ in D Major by ‘Pachelbel’ (the scare quotes indicate that the piece is neither a canon nor likely composed by Pachelbel). It’s prevalence in popular music has recently been made famous by comedian Rob Paravonian's ["Pachelbel Rant."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdxkVQy7QLM).

The full progression is given above, but there are a few common alterations. First, the cadential progression may be changed (substituting two bars of V or a cadential 6/4–5/3 for the final IV–V progression). Also, instead of moving in root-position triads, some composers and songwriters will invert every other chord:

**&#124;&#124;: I – V<sup>6</sup> – VI – III<sup>6</sup> – IV – I<sup>6</sup> – IV – V :&#124;&#124;**

Lastly, some composers or songwriters will only use the first four or five chords and follow with a completely new second half. As long as the first four chords—in root position or with the standard inversions—are present, we can consider it an instance of the Pachelbel progression.

**I – V – VI – III . . .** (to begin a phrase; "truncated" version)

Here are a few of the numerous examples mentioned by Paravonian that feature the Pachelbel progression:
