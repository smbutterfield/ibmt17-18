title: Keyboard-style voice-leading schemata
---

Following are a number of *schemata* for keyboard-style voice-leading. Some of these are patterns that are common enough to warrant special attention (and memorization). Others require non-default voice-leading or doublings. In any case, these are worth memorizing to assist both in composition/arranging and in recognition of standard patterns. (Some will also come in handy for chorale-style voice-leading.)


## Voice exchange ##

A *voice exchange* occurs when the melody and bass lines exchange pitches over the course of a simple contrapuntal prolongation. For example, in the progression **T1 D2 T3**, the bass begins on *do* and ends on *mi*. In a voice exchange, the melody would reverse this, starting on *mi* and ending on *do*. This common pattern can use a **V<sup>6/4</sup>**, **V<sup>4/3</sup>**, or a **VII<sup>6/3</sup>** chord for **D2**:

Using this voice exchange pattern will ensure smooth voice-leading throughout the prolongation.

Note that the *fa* in the **D2** passing chord (a functional dissonance) of the second example does *not* resolve down to *mi*. This is permissible because *mi* is required of the bass line but cannot be doubled, and because the smooth outer-voice counterpoint and stepwise inner-voice motion counteract any harshness perceived by the unresolved dissonance.

The voice exchange can also be used with a **D4** substitution chord. Note that the upper voices will be exactly the same as using a **V<sup>6/4</sup>** for **D2**.

![][D4i] 

These patterns can be used in major or minor, transposed to any key, and the **D2** voice exchanges can be used in reverse, as well—**T3 D2 T1**. They can also be used to prolong S and D: **S4 T5 S6** or **D5 S6 D7**, for example.


## Parallel tenths ##

*Do–re–mi* in the bass is also frequently accompanied by *mi–fa–sol* in the melody, making *parallel tenths*.

![][ParallelTenths]

Note here that, like the *fa* in the **D2** voice exchange, the *fa* in the melody is an unresolved functional dissonance. In this case, the voice leading once again is so smooth that it overrides the need for the functional dissonance to resolve.

This pattern can also be used in major or minor, transposed to any key, and in reverse. It almost always uses a **V<sup>4/3</sup>** for **D2**.

## Champagne progression ##

While **T(1 D2p 3)** is a perfectly acceptable way to accompany *mi–fa–sol* in the melody, a more interesting (and also more involved) way to harmonize that melody is what theorist Gene Biringer called the *champagne progression*: **T1 S6 T3**. (He called it this because it is "the progression you use when you want to impress a date.")

The champagne progression is very nice, but must be treated carefully. *Only* use it with *mi–fa–sol* (or *me–fa–sol*) in the melody, and *always* use the following voice-leading (note the non-standard doubling of the bass—*la*/*le*—in the **S6** chord).

![][Champagne]

The standard champagne progression (above) uses a **I<sup>6</sup>** chord for **T3**. Following is a variant using **III** for **T3**, which Biringer dubbed "pink champagne," because it is especially nice. It should also be especially *rare*, or it loses its punch. 

![][PinkChampagne]

The champagne progression should only be used to prolong tonic function.

## Deceptive resolution ##

A *deceptive resolution* occurs When a **D5** (**V** or **V<sup>7</sup>**) chord does not progress, as expected, to **I**  to form an authentic cadence, but instead progresses to **VI**. In the deceptive resolution, it is important for *ti* to resolve to *do*—as it would in an authentic cadence—not *la*/*le*. This fulfills its role as a tendency tone, helps the "deception" to work, and avoids the dissonant augmented second *ti*–*le* in minor. This results in a non-standard doubling of VI (*do*, rather than the bass).

## Leaving out the fifth ##

When *ti*–*do* appears in the melody of an authentic cadence involving **V<sup>7</sup>**, it is impossible to fully voice both chords *and* resolve the functional dissonance.

![][D5problem]

It is imperative to resolve this functional dissonance, as that resolution is an important contributor to the goal-oriented motion and the releasing of harmonic tension into the cadential arrival. In order to do so, either leave out the fifth of the **I** chord (and triple the bass):

![][T1dropFifth]

or leave out the fifth of the **V<sup>7</sup>** chord, and double the bass:

![][D5dropFifth]

The incomplete **V<sup>7</sup>** is preferable to the incomplete **I**, but voice-leading into the **V<sup>7</sup>** will usually dictate which option you choose.

## Leaving out the third ##

When an **S4** progresses into a **D5**, and both are *seventh chords*, it can be impossible to prepare and resolve the functional dissonances of both chords while fully voicing them.

![][S4problem]

Instead, leave *la*/*le* out of the **S4** chord and double the bass. This will retain the trigger and bass note *fa*, as well as the two pitches making the dissonance (*do* and *re* or *mi*/*me* and *fa*), and will allow a second *fa* in an upper voice that can prepare the seventh of the **D5** chord.
