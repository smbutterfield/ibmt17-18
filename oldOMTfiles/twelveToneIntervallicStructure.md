title: Twelve-Tone Music — Intervallic Structure
---

Pitch-class orderings are not the only things ordered by twelve-tone rows. Because pitch classes are always in relationships with one another, a twelve-tone row is also an ordered collection of *intervals.* Understanding the intervallic structure of a row class is the best way to get a sense of what it will sound like.    

Below, you'll see the figure from resource on [operations](twelveToneOperations.html). Below each of the row forms in that example, I have shown the series of [ordered pitch-class intervals](interval(Class).html).

Rows that are **transpositionally-related** (as **P11** and **P10** are) have _the same_ series of ordered pitch-class intervals.

Rows that are **inversionally-related** (as **P10** and **I0** are) have *complementary* ordered pitch-class intervals. That is, intervals in corresponding locations in the row forms "sum to 12."

Rows that are **retrograde-related** have ordered pitch-class intervals that are _reverse complements_. Compare **P10** and **R10**. Reading **R10** backwards, the *final* three intervals (for example) are 4 1 8. Those are the complements of **P10**′s *first* three intervals: 8 11 4.

Rows that are **retrograde-inversion related** have ordered pitch-class intervals that are _reverses_ of one another. Compare **P10** and **RI0**. Reading **RI0**′s intervals backwards, you'll notice that they are the _same_ as **P10**′s read forwards.
