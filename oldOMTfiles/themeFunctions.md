This page is a quick-reference. For examples of these functions in musical contexts, see the resource on [Classical theme types](classicalThemes.html).

# Initiating Functions

## Presentation

*Presentation function* comes at the *beginning* of a theme or phrase. It involves the *establishment of the primary melodic material* (usually through the use of one or more statements of a *basic idea*) and the *establishment of the tonality of the theme* (usually through *tonic prolongation*). 

## Antecedent

*Antecedent function* comes at the *beginning* of a theme or phrase. It involves the statement of a *basic idea* followed by a *contrasting idea.* An *antecedent* should close with a weak cadence, usually a HC or IAC.

# Medial Functions

## Continuation

*Continuation function* comes in the *middle* of a phrase or theme. It typically involves the *breakdown of the primary melodic material* and *harmonic acceleration* towards the cadence.

Following are important terms/concepts associated with continuation function. Not all need be present for a passage to express continuation function, but some should be.

- *Fragmentation* – Breaking the melodic unit into smaller chunks (for example, following two-bar basic ideas in the presentation with one-bar melodic ideas). Note: fragmentation references the breakdown of the *size* of the units. Those units are not necessarily related melodically.  
- *Liquidation* – Gradually replacing the *characteristic* or unique parts of a melody with *conventional* or common elements.  
- *Sequential repetition* – Repeating the same melodic or harmonic element two or three times, transposed to different pitch levels. This is often used in conjunction with fragmentation.  
- *Acceleration of melodic rhythm* – Changing from predominately quarter notes and eighth notes in the melody to predominately eighth notes and sixteenth notes, for example.  
- *Acceleration of harmonic rhythm* – Chord changes coming more frequently (changing from one chord per bar to two chords per bar, for example).  

#Closing Functions

## Cadential

*Cadential function* comes at the end of a theme or phrase. It typically involves a *cadential harmonic progression* and a *conventional, descending melodic pattern*.

A classical cadential progression *begins with the last chord of tonic prolongation* and *ends with a cadential arrival*. The [three typical types of cadential arrival](cadenceTypes.html) in Classical music are the perfect authentic cadence (PAC), the imperfect authentic cadence (IAC), and the half cadence (HC). 

A half-cadential progression will begin with the final **T** chord, progress (optionally) through **S**, and arrive on a cadential **D** chord (*always* **D5**: **V** or **V<sup>7</sup>**):

> **T__ (S__) D5**

An authentic-cadential progression will begin with the final **T** chord, progress (optionally) through **S**, and end with the cadential **D T** progression (*always* **D5 T1**: **V<sup>(7)</sup> I**):

> **T_ (S_) D5 T1**

## Consequent

*Consequent function* resembles *antecedent function* in that it involves the presentation of a basic idea followed by a contrasting one. Unlike the *antecedent function*, however, *consequent function* brings completion to a thematic unit. Therefore, it ends with a strong cadence, typically a PAC.  


<!--

## General notes ##

Just as there is exactly one progression through **T (S) D T** for every cadence in classical music, there is exactly one progression through **presentation – continuation – cadential** functions for every cadence in classical music.

None of these functions are optional; all must be present in a normative formal progression.-->
