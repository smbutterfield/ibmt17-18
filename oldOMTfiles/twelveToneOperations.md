title: Twelve-Tone Music — Operations

Like pitch-class sets, twelve-tone rows can be transposed (*Tn*),  inverted (*I*), or transposed and inverted (*TnI*). Like [transposing a pitch-class set](transposition.html), transposing a row is accomplished by *adding* a constant value to all of the pitch-classes of the row *while maintaining the order*. In the example below, I have transposed **P11** by *T11* by adding 11 to each of the pitch classes of **P11**. The new row is called **P10** because it begins with pitch class 10. 

Inversion occurs when we *subtract* each pitch class of the row from a constant value. Again referring to the example below, when I do *T10I* of **P11** is accomplished by subtracting every pitch class of **P11** from 10.

Twelve-tone rows can be _retrograded_ as well, symbolized as *R*. To retrograde a row we read it backwards. Reading **P11** backwards results in the row form shown below **P11** in the example: R11. (Remember that retrograde rows are labeld according to their *final* pitch class.) Reading **I0** backwards results in **RI0**—just below it in the example.

It's important that you know the difference between *operations* and row forms, because they are often labeled similarly. In these resources *operations* like transposition and inversion will always be italicized. ***Row forms*** will be bolded.

You need to memorize the effect of transposing, inverting, or retrograding any particular type of row. That is, you should know what kind of ***row form*** results when you perform any *operation* on it. For example, if you *transpose* a **P-form,** what kind of row form results? What about when you retrograde an **RI-form**? The flowchart below will be helpful:
