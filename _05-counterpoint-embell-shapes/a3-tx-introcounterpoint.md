### Counterpoint Overview

Why study counterpoint in a tonal harmony class when counterpoint is a study of melody?
You need to provide expectation, and you need to fulfill or deny it. 
Music is a series of tension and release. 

For composers who don't conform to the standard rules of tonal harmony (ae. Stravinskii, Babbitt, etc.), people have a harder time listening because it doesn't do what our ears expect it to. 
The good composers of this style will create a new tonality for your ear to build expectations upon within every new piece. 

Counterpoint deals with the relationship of two lines and how they interract with each other.
Harmony came much later than counterpoint. 
18th Century counterpoint is the base of what we study.

Consonant and Dissonant Intervals:
- Perfect Consonance:
    - Perfect 5ths
    - Perfect Octave
    - Perfect Unison
    
    (Perfect 4th was mentioned, but is not a Perfect Consonance)
- Imperfect Consonance:
    - Major 3rd
    - Minor 3rd
    - Major 6th
    - Minor 6th
    
    (Perfect 4th was mentioned again but is also not an Imperfect Consonance)
- Dissonance:
    - Major 2nd
    - Minor 2nd
    - Perfect 4th
    - Augmented 4th
    - Diminished 5th
    - Major 7th
    - Minor 7th
    
Perfect 4th's are very dissonant in 18th Century counterpoint. 
A Perfect 4th undermines the key's structure because it does not pull toward the tonic. 
It implies a pull toward a new key, which is not a factor in 18th Century counterpoint.

Contrapuntal Motion:
- paralell: two lines move in the same direction
  - both lines move in the same interval
  - interval size stays the same
- contrary: two lines move in opposite motion from one another
- static: two lines stay on the same notes 
  - technically a type of paralell motion
- oblique: one line stays the same and the other line moves in any direction

###Types of contrapuntal motion

There are four types of contrapuntal motion between two musical lines. Differentiating these four types of motion is essential to generating good voice-leading, both strict and free.

In *parallel motion*, two voices move in the same direction by the same generic interval. For example, the following two voices both move up by a step. Note also that both dyads form the same generic interval (sixth). This will always be true when two voices move in parallel motion.

![Example of parallel motion: C–A to D–B.][parallel]

In *similar motion*, also called *direct motion*, two voices move in the same direction, but by different intervals. For example, the following two voices both move down, but the upper voice moves by step while the lower voice moves by leap. Note also that the two dyads are different generic intervals. This will always be the case with similar or direct motion.

![Example of similar motion: C–G to A–F.][similar]

In *contrary motion*, two voices move in opposite directions—one up, the other down.

![Example of contrary motion: C–E to A–F.][contrary]

In *oblique motion*, one voice is stationary, while the other voice moves (in either direction). The stationary tone may or may not be rearticulated.
