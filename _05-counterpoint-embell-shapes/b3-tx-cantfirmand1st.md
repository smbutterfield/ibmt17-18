## Class discussion

As the class developed rules, their observations were naturally divided by whether they were looking within a line versus when they compared the two lines. Horizontal versus vertical. Melodic versus harmonic.

### Melodic intervals and structure
- Length
    - 8 to 14 notes
- Starting and ending pitches: 
    - Starts and ends on a perfect 8ve (or unison) of the tonic pitch  
- Approaching final note: 
    - By stepwise contrary motion which means that one voice will have `ti` and the other `re`
- Repeated pitches
    - generally no repeated notes
        - this means that static and oblique motion do not occur in first species because they both require at least one voice to repeat pitches
- Climax
    - The line should have a clear high (or low point) which means that the highest (or lowest) pitch  
- Leaps
    - should be used sparingly because
    - too many leaps imply triadic harmony, and that didn't exist yet
    - always leave a leap by step 


You can sometimes leap to and step from a high or low point. 
You can sometimes step to and leap from a high or low point. 
Never leap to or leap from a high or low point, as a general rule use stepwise motion as much as possible.
Thirds or other leaps imply triadic harmony. 

#### Harmonic intervals and structure

Valid starting and ending harmonic intervals
- consonant intervals
    - perfect 8ve
    - perfect 5th

Approaching perfect intervals
- only approach by oblique or contrary motion
    - oblique motion is not allowed in 1st species

Perfect/Imperfect Intervals (consonant):
- perfect:
    - 8ve
    - 5th
- imperfect:
    - 6th 
    - 3rd

#### Acceptable Motion Between Lines

Types of motion
- parallel 
- contrary
    - always okay
- static
- oblique
- similar
    mostly okay
    - In 1st species counterpoint, because there are no repeated notes, that rules out static and oblique motion.
    1st Species only uses parallel, contrary, and similar motion. 
    - Similar motion is less common because it is easy to have part writing errors. 

Types of Errors:
- parallel octaves and fifths
- contrary octaves and fifths
- similar/direct/hidden octaves and fifths

Parallel perfect octaves and fifths are not okay. Using the same pitch is the same as monophony.
Contrary octaves are when you have two intervals of an octave in a row and they move in contrary motion. 
You still have two octaves in a row, even if they were approached by contrary motion. 
Similar motion is when you approach a perfect fifth or octave in similar motion from any interval. 
Approaching a perfect interval by similar motion makes it more difficult to hear the interval and paints you into a corner when writing counterpoint as well. 
Similar motion is also called direct motion, and hidden motion.

### Cantus firmi

A number of others are provided [here][CFs]. Performing these is a helpful practice to develop an internal sense of the sound and feel of a well formed *cantus*, and many of the characteristics of well formed *cantus firmi* carry over into other musical styles. (These model *cantus firmi* can also be used as the starting points for our two-voice exercises.)

From these *cantus*, notice how the general musical characteristics of smoothness, melodic integrity, variety, and motion towards a goal are worked out in specific characteristics. The following characteristics are typical of all well formed *cantus firmi*:

- length of about 8–16 notes  
- arhythmic (all whole notes; no long or short notes)  
- begin and end on *do*  
- approach final tonic by step (usually *re*–*do*, sometimes *ti*–*do*)  
- all note-to-note progressions are [melodic consonances](intervals.html)  
- range (interval between lowest and highest notes) of no more than a tenth, usually less than an octave  
- a single climax (high point) that appears only once in the melody  
- clear logical connection and smooth shape from beginning to climax to ending  
- mostly stepwise motion, but with some leaps (mostly small leaps)  
- no repetition of "motives" or "licks"  
- any large leaps (fourth or larger) are followed by step in opposite direction  
- no more than two leaps in a row; no consecutive leaps in the same direction (Fux's F-major *cantus* is an exception, where the back-to-back descending leaps outline a consonant triad.)  
- the leading tone progresses to the tonic  
- in minor, the leading tone only appears in the penultimate bar; the raised submediant is only used when progressing to that leading tone

#### Melodic tendencies

The characteristics listed above are fairly detailed, and some of them are specific to strict species counterpoint. However, taken together, they express in detail some general tendencies of melodies in a variety of styles.

[David Huron](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL5851060W/Sweet_Anticipation) identifies five general properties of melodies in Western music that connect to the basic principles of perception and cognition listed above, but play out in slightly different specific ways in musical styles. They are:

- **pitch proximity** – the tendency for melodies to progress by steps more than leaps and by small leaps more than large leaps. An expression of smoothness and melodic integrity.  
- **step declination** – the tendency for melodies to move by *descending* step more than ascending. Possibly an expression of goal-oriented motion, as we tend to perceive a move down as a decrease in energy (movement towards a state of rest).  
- **step inertia** – the tendency for melodies to change direction less frequently than they continue in the same direction. (I.e., the majority of melodic progressions are in the same direction as the previous one.) An expression of smoothness and, at times, goal-oriented motion.  
- **melodic regression** – the tendency for melodic notes in extreme registers to progress back towards the middle. An expression of motion towards a position of rest (with non-extreme notes representing "rest"). Also an expression simply of the statistical distribution of notes in a melody: the higher a note is, the more notes there are below it for a composer to choose from, and the less notes there are above it.  
- **melodic arch** – the tendency for melodies to ascend in the first half of a phrase, reach a climax, and descend in the second half. An expression of goal-orientation and the rest–motion–rest pattern. Also, a combination of the above rules in the context of a musical phrase.

### First species counterpoint

Counterpoint is the mediation of two or more musical *lines* into a meaningful and pleasing *whole*. In first-species counterpoint, we not only write a smooth melody that has its own integrity of shape, variety, and goal-directed motion, but we also write a second melody that contains these traits. Further, and most importantly, we combine these melodies to create a whole texture that is smooth, exhibits variety and goal-oriented motion, and in which these melodies both maintain their independence and fuse together into consonant *simultaneities* (the general term for two or more notes sounding at the same time).

#### The counterpoint line

In general, the counterpoint should follow the principles of [writing a good cantus firmus][CF]. There are some minor differences, to be discussed below, but generally a first-species counterpoint should consist of two cantus-firmus-quality lines.

#### Beginning a first-species counterpoint

To exemplify goal-oriented motion, the first-species exercise should begin and end with the most stable of sonorities: perfect consonances. Thus, when writing a counterpoint *above* a cantus firmus, the first note of the counterpoint should be *do* or *sol* (a P1, P5, or P8 above the cantus).

When writing a counterpoint *below* a cantus firmus, the first note of the counterpoint must always be *do* (P1 or P8 below the cantus). (Beginning on *sol* would create a dissonant fourth; beginning on *fa* would create a P5 but confuse listeners about the tonal context, since *fa–do* at the beginning of a piece is easily misheard as *do–sol*.)

#### Ending a first-species counterpoint

The final note of the counterpoint must always be *do* (P1 or P8 above/below the cantus).

To approach this ending smoothly, with variety, and with strong goal orientation, always approach the final interval by contrary stepwise motion. If the cantus ends *re*–*do*, the counterpoint's final two pitches should be *ti*–*do*. If the cantus ends *ti*–*do*, the counterpoint's final two pitches should be *re*–*do*. Thus the penultimate bar will either be a minor third or a major sixth between the two lines. This is the case for both major and minor keys.

#### Independence of the lines

Like the cantus firmus, the counterpoint should have a single climax. To maintain the independence of the lines and the smoothness of the entire passage (so no one moment is hyper-emphasized by a double climax), these climaxes should not coincide.

A single repeat/tie in the counterpoint is allowed, but try to avoid repeating at all. This promotes variety in the exercise, since there are so few notes to begin with.

Avoid *voice crossing*, where the upper voice is temporarily lower than the lower voice, and *vice versa*. Voice crossings diminish the independence of the lines and make them more difficult to distinguish by ear.

Avoid *voice overlap*, where one voice leaps past the previous note of the other voice. For example, if the upper part sings an E4, the lower part cannot sing an F4 in the following bar. This also helps maintain the independence of the lines.


#### Intervals and motion

The interval between the cantus and counterpoint at any moment should not exceed a perfect twelfth (octave plus fifth). In general, try to keep the two lines within an octave where possible, and only exceed a tenth in "emergencies," and only briefly (one or two notes). When the voices are too far apart, tonal fusion is diminished. Further, it can diminish *performability*, which though not an essential principle of human cognition is an important consideration for composers, and it has a direct effect on the smoothness, melodic integrity, and tonal fusion of what listeners hear during a performance.

In general, all harmonic *consonances* are allowed. However, unisons should only be used for first and last intervals. Unisons are very stable, and serve best as goals rather than mid points. They also diminish the independence of the lines.

*Imperfect consonances* are preferable to *perfect consonances* for all intervals other than the first and last dyads, in order to heighten the sense of arrival at the end, and to promote a sense of motion towards that arrival. In all cases, aim for a variety of harmonic intervals over the course of the exercise.

*Never, ever, ever* use two perfect consonances of the same size in a row: **P5–P5** or **P8–P8**. This includes both simple and compound intervals. For example, **P5–P12** is considered the same as **P5–P5**. (Two different perfect consonances in a row, such as **P8–P5**, is allowed, however, but try to follow every perfect consonance with an imperfect consonance if possible.) These "parallel fifths and octaves" significantly promote tonal fusion over melodic independence at the same time that the consecutive stable sonorities arrest both the variety and the motion of the exercise. Thus, they are far from ideal, and to be avoided in species counterpoint.

Vary the types of motion between successive intervals (parallel, similar, contrary, oblique). Try to use all types of motion (except, perhaps, oblique motion), but prefer contrary motion where possible. It is best for preserving the independence of the lines, in addition to variety. 

Because similar and parallel motion diminish variety and melodic independence, their use should be mediated by other factors:

- Do not use more than three of the same imperfect consonance type in a row (e.g., three thirds in a row).  
- *Never* move into a perfect consonance by similar motion (this is called *direct* or *hidden octaves*). This draws too much attention to an interval which already stands out of the texture.  
- Avoid combining similar motion with leaps, especially large ones.

### Demonstration

In the following video, I illustrate the process of composing a first-species counterpoint. This video provides new information about the compositional process, as well as concrete examples of the above rules and principles.
