In second-species counterpoint, the counterpoint line moves in half notes against a cantus firmus in whole notes. This 2:1 rhythmic ratio leads to two new "fundamental musical problems"â€”one metric and one harmonic: the differentiation between *strong beats* and *weak beats*, and the introduction of the *passing tone* dissonance.

*An example second-species exercise by Heinrich Schenker.*

The introduction of harmonic dissonance into second species adds to the variety of the musical texture. However, it brings a tension that must be balanced with consonance to promote tonal fusion, and it requires careful attention in order to maintain smoothness in and out of the dissonance.
