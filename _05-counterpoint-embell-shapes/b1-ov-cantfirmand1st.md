title: Overview 5b - Cantus Firmus and 1:1 Counterpoint
---

Exercises in strict voice-leading, or species counterpoint, begin with a single, well formed musical line called the *cantus firmus* (fixed voice, or fixed melody; pl. *cantus firmi*). *Cantus firmus* composition gives us the opportunity to engage the following fundamental musical traits:

- smoothness  
- independence and integrity of melodic lines  
- variety  
- motion (towards a goal)

## 1:1 Counterpoint (first species)

In first species counterpoint, we begin with a *cantus firmus* (new or existing) and compose a single new line—called the *counterpoint*—above or below the cantus firmus. That new line contains one note for every note in the cantus: both the cantus firmus and the counterpoint will be all whole notes. Thus, first species is sometimes called one-against-one or 1:1 counterpoint.
