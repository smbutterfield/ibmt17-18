title: 19a Examples - Extended Tertian Harmonies and Non-chord Tones
abc: true
---

To this point in the course, we have only studied harmony based on triads and seventh chords, but as we have shown in the units covering chromaticism, triads and seventh chords are just a symptom of the underlying voice leading that makes tonality work. Because of this, it is possible to have extensions beyond seventh chords that function as chord tones. Analyze the following excerpt from the famous tune *The Girl from Ipanema* composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim. Label each chord with leadhseet symbols and Roman numerals with inversion figures as well as all non-chord tones. (Note that measure 6 is particularly tricky if you have never seen a tri-tone substitution in jazz. For that measure, you may want to consider the melody separately and change one pitch of the chorale chord to create an augmented sixth chord.)

How did you deal with the first measure of this tune? It is clearly an Fmaj7 chord, but the melody starts prominently on the ninth of the chord, and that G cannot be labeled as any kind of non-chord tone.

## Extended tertian harmony versus non-chord tones

The first measure of *The Girl from Ipanema* is a perfect example of functional extended harmonies and should help you begin creating a decision tree to determine whether a tone is a non-chord tone or a functional extension. Because the G is clearly and prominently functioning as a chord tone, we must consider this harmony to be an Fmaj9 chord.

As we have discussed repeatedly in this course, harmonic analysis is the art of determining which pitches are functional to the harmony and which pitches are embellishment. As we move into an expanded view of tonal harmony, it is imperative that you are extremely familiar with the details of non-chord tones in Unit 9a, because these shapes will provide a foundation to help you begin determining what is functional. Simply put, if you cannot label a pitch as one of the possible non-chord tone shapes, then it is most likely a functioning chord tone. If there more than four pitches for a given harmony that fall into this category, it means that you must consider the concept of extended tertian harmonies such as ninth chords.

Before you go further, you may wish to refresh yourself on the Roman numeral labeling conventions outlines in Unit 6a. In particular, the section that discusses the terms <sup>add</sup> and <sup>sub</sup> are important to our labeling of extended tertian harmonies.

## Differentiation as a process

While most musicians have at least a passing familiarity with extended tertian harmonies in jazz and pop, they exist in all tonal harmony styles. Analyze the following examples by labeling all chords with Roman numerals, inversion figures, and non-chord tones.

When I analyze these pieces, I find that the first and third excerpts have ninth chords.
