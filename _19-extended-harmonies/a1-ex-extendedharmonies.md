## Extended versus non-chord tones

Discuss importance of understanding non-chord tone shapes
Sometimes, there will be no arrangement of chord tones and non-chord tones that is just a triad or seventh chord, and in these cases, you must consider the possibility of an extended tertian harmony.
Still fulfills the same functions as triads and seventh chords, but there will be a ninth (or higher) that is functioning as part of the chord.
