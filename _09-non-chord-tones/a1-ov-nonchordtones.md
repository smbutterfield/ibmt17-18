title: 9a Overview - Non-chord Tones
---

We have already covered three of the most common types of non-chord tones (NCTs): *passing tones*, *neighbor tones*, and *suspensions*. In these discussions, we identified certain characteristics that we could use to classify each of the non-chord tones.
- the preparation
    - type of movement used to approach the NCT
    - direction from which the NCT is approached
- the non-chord tone
    - must not be a member of the chord
- the resolution
    - type of movement used to leave the NCT
    - direction from which the NCT is left *in realtion to the preparation*

By describing these characteristics, we can create definitions for A *passing tone* (PT) is a non-chord tone which is approached by step and left by step in the same direction.

A *neighbor tone* (NT) is a non-chord tone which is approached by step and left by step in the opposite direction.

A *suspension* (SUS) is a non-chord tone which is approached by static motion and resolves downward by step.

## Describing non-chord tones

This information provides a methodology and framework through which we can look at all non-chord tones, but we need further language to describe the function and characteristics of any non-chord tone.
- Accented vs unaccented
    - An accented NCT occurs on a beat, and an unaccented NCT occurs on an offbeat.
    - Most types of NCTs can be either accented or unaccented, but certain NCTs, such as suspensions, can only be one or the other. (For example, suspensions can only be accented.)
- Chromatic vs diatonic
    - Diatonic NCTs use only the notes present in the key-signature whereas chromatic NCTs have an accidental.
    - All types of NCTs can be either chromatic or diatonic, although some are extremely rare (such as a chromatic suspension).
- There are other possibilities for labeling NCTs such as ascending/descending and upper/lower. These are only applicable to certain NCTs, so it is easier to discuss these labels in those contexts.
    - Passing tones can be either ascending or descending.
    - Neighbor tones can be either upper or lower.
