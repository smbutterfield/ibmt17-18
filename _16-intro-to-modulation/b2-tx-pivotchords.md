## Pivot Chords

Pivot chords are a way to modulate.
There are other ways to modulate, but we're going to focus on pivot chords.

Pivot chords:
- find a chord that is common in the current key and the key you are going to
- use that chord (and its fuction in each key) to pivot to the new key
- it functions in the progression for both keys
  - when writing a pivot modulation, you use a bracket to deliniate what portions are in each key
  - good pivot chords have a progression on both sides that follows a circle progression
  
When working on modulations, lead sheet symbols become your best friend.
You can use the lead sheet symbols to identify where the key center changes based on the use of diatonic and chromatic harmony. 

### Simple Modulations

#### Ex: Haydn's Piano Sonata in G major, mvt. 3
Looking at 4 measures of the Haydn, we have:
G - G/D - D7 - G/B - D7/A - G - G - A7/C# - D - A7/G - D

In G, this would be analyzed as:
I - I64 - V7 - I6 - V43 - I - I - V65/V - V - V/V - V

Why does a V/V start on the 2nd scale degree?
You need to establish a tonic. 
What we do with non-diatonic harmony is find a way for it to function in the diatonic harmony. 

If we have the progression of A - G - C, you can't tell what key it's in. 
If we're in C with the same chord progression, you get a V/V - V - I.
- it's a way of explaining non-diatonic harmony

Now, analyze the same passage in D: 
IV - IV64 - V7/IV - V43/IV - IV - IV- V65 - I - V V/V - V

By comparing the analysis of the example between the two keys, you can find where the modulation occurs in a way that gives both sections common progressions. 

### Distantly Related Keys

The further-away keys are from each other, the more difficult to modulate between the two. 
How to find a modulation:
- Look for accidentals
- Go back 1 chord

#### Ex: Distantly Related Keys
- you have G major going to F minor: two distantly related keys
- compare the triads of the scale to each other and look for shared chords
  - the only shared chord between the two is C major

### Approaching a Modulation

- write in lead sheet symbols
  - with lead sheet, you can look at where new chords out of the key appear
  
#### Example in Bb

Soprano: C5 - D5 - E5

Alto: F4 - F4 - E4

Tenor: A3 - B3 - C4

Bass: F3 - D3 - C3

Bb: V ] (now in c minor)

cmin: [ V/VII - viio - i

- analysis can also look like:

Bb: V - viio6/ii - x

cmin: x - viio6 - i

Names for pivot chords not shared in both keys:
- secondary function pivot
- altered pivot
  - it's not a standard pivot because it's not on a common chord
  
modulation point: the place where we first hear the modulation
  - go one chord back from the modulation point and that is where you will find a pivot chord
  
We have 2 types of pivot modulations:
1. Common Chord Pivot Modulations
  - pivots on chords shared between the two keys
  - these take priority over secondary function pivot chords
2. Secondary Function Pivot Modulations
  - pivots on chords not shared between keys, but a secondary function in one key and a common chord in the other
