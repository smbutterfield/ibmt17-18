## Common-tone modulation

## Direct modulation

## Altered pivot

Secondary function in one or both keys
Only use when no common pivot is present


This one pivots on a viio/ii = viio
Interesting because the F major chord before it could be a V/bVII in B-flat which then resolves to a Bdim...aka a B-flat triad where the root has been moved up a half-step
