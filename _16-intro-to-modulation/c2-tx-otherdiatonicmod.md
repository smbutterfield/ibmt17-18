## Alternate Modulatory Methods
### Direct Modulation (Phrase Modulation)
 #### Ex: Bach Chorale Erkenne mich mein Huter
 Lead sheet: B - E (on fermata) - B#o/D#
 In E: V - I - x
 In c#min: x - III - viio6
 - why does this not work?
  - the III to viio is not a functional progression
 - it modulates to the relative minor
 
 BUT because we have the fermata and the end of a phrase, we have a direct modulation (or phrase modulation) and it's okay!
 This is a direct (or phrase) modulation.
 These are commonly used in pop and Broadway music to build emotion. 
 When labeling them in analysis, you don't need the pivot chord bracket.
 Again, if you find a common chord pivot modulation first, use that.
 
 There is a hierarchy of modulations:
 1. Common Chord Pivot Modulations
 2. Secondary Function Pivot Modulations
 3. Direct Modulation (Phrase Modulation)
 
 ### Common Tone Modulation
Common tone modulations occur when a modulation happens through one note being common in both keys. 
- this note *has* to be emphasized
  - in D minor, the C# can be used to modulate to F# major. 
  - in A major, the C# can be used to modulate to F# major. 
- this can be any scale degree 

Isolating the common tone with nothing else around it can give your ear a break from the past key enough to introduce *any* ney key. 
We label these with pivot brackets, but instead of chords we put scale degrees. 

In the hierarchy:
1. Common Chord Pivot Modulations
2. Secondary Function Pivot Modulations
3. Direct Modulation (Phrase Modulation)
4. Common Tone Modulation
