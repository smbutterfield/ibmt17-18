## What is a modulation?

A *modulation* occurs when a tonal piece of music changes the tonic pitch from one pitch to another. Most musicians understand this concept on a basic level, but there are a few common misconceptions. 
- Modulations are sometimes referred to as a "key change", but this can be confusing because the key signature does not necessarily need to be altered for a modulation to occur. 
- The term key change also does not account for the fact that a shift between the parallel major and minor modes (e.g. C major to C minor) is *not* a modulation but could necessitate a change of key signature. This is a shift in mode -- not a modulation -- because the tonic does not change.

## Key relationships

To begin studying modulations, we will look at modulations between closely-related keys. *Closely-related keys* are keys that are within one accidental of each other. Each key has five closely-related keys. Try to come up with the closely-related keys for:
- C major
- A minor
- C-sharp major
- E-flat minor
When determining closely-related keys, it is helpful to think of the *relative* major and minor keys as well as their closely-related keys, but the *parallel* major or minor is always a distantly-related key.

## Differentiating modulation and tonicization?

The biggest difficulty regarding modulation is differentiating between modulation and tonicization. Some modulations will be obvious, but others can be contentious. Because a modulation is defined by a change in the tonic, it is necessary to consider how music establishes tonic in the listener's ear. In earlier units, we discussed the importance of phrasing and cadences, but the following exercise will further clarify their importance.

On a scratch piece of paper, do the following instructions for each of the examples below:
1. Listen to the entire excerpt, and at the end, sing the tonic (`do`). Use your ear-training while looking at the final chord to determine which pitch you sang. Write this on your scratch paper.
2. Listen to the excerpt again, but pause each time you come to the end of a phrase. Each time you pause the excerpt, sing `do`. This may require you to sing up or down to `do` because some of the phrase endings do not have `do` in the chord. (i.e. if there is a half cadence)
3. Compare your tonics from each phrase. Are they all the same? Does it change throughout the excerpt?

Some of these examples modulate, yet some are only tonicizations. What do all of the modulations have in common? What about the tonicizations? How does this change your perception of modulation? Is there some commonality among the modulations that will help you visually identify a modulation if you do not have access to playback or a recording?
