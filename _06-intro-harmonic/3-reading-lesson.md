### Harmonic Analysis:

Notes from the reading:
- parallel fifths and octaves are still not okay
  - the two notes lose independence from each other when they have PP5 and PP8
- now that we have 4 notes for 4-part harmony, we want to hear all 4 notes in the harmony
  - this avoidance of parallel fifths and octaves is completely stylistic
- circle of fifths progressions are the foundation of music 
  - the more you break traditional rules, the more you create a new style of your own
  
#### Figured Bass

Figured bass is the way we label function within a piece of music. 
It is most often used as shorthand for keyboardists.
  - also called thoughrough bass, or basso continuo
  
These pianists became great improvisors because they had a bass line and figured bass.
Everything else had to be improvised. 
They would read a bass line and see small numbers or accidentals and assume the other implied notes for the harmony.
 
It is important not to mix Lead Sheet Notation, Figured Bass, and Roman Numeral Analysis.
Firgured bass does not exist without a bass line. 
Roman numerals tell you the bass line and give us context.
Lead sheet notation gives you absolutes and tell you the exact pitches to use.
