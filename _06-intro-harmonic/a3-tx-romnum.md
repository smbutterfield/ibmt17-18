## Labeling chords ##

There are two ways in which we will label chords according to function. The first is to label chords with Roman numerals, thoroughbass figures, and functional labels. When doing so, place the appropriate Roman numeral *below* the bass line, the thoroughbass figure *above* the bass line (since it represents the upper voices), and place a functional label **T**/**S**/**D** below the Roman numeral (no **Tx**; simply call a **VI** chord **T**). For now this label can simply apply T, S, or D to individual chords; in the future, we will alter this practice slightly in order to show [functional prolongation](harmonicSyntax2.html). The first example shows individual chord functions, and the second example shows functional prolongation.

The second way to label a harmonic progression is what Quinn calls *functional bass*. Functional bass symbols combine a chord's function (**T**, **S**, **D**, or **Tx**) with an Arabic numeral denoting the scale degree of its bass note. A tonic chord with *do* in the bass is **T1**, a dominant chord with *ti* in the bass is **D7**, etc. If the bass note is chromatically altered, use a **+** or **–** to denote raised or lowered (*la* and *ti* in minor do not count, since *le*, *la*, *te*, and *ti* all belong to minor, but you can use +/– for clarity if you like). And if there is a chromatically altered note anywhere in the chord, put the functional bass symbol inside square brackets: **[S6]**, **[S+4]**, **[T–7]**, etc. (See [Chromatically altered subdominant chords](alteredSubdominants.html), [Applied chords](appliedChords.html), and [Modal mixture](modalMixture.html) for more information on common chromatically altered chords.)

Quinn also advocates using what I call *interpreted functional bass*. This nomenclature uses the same symbols, but uses parentheses to denote [*contrapuntal prolongation*](http://openmusictheory.com/harmonicSyntax2.html) and lower-case postscripts to explain the contrapuntal role of the embellishing chord (p for passing, n for neighbor, i for incomplete neighbor, d for divider, e for embellishing — all of these refer to the voice-leading pattern in the bass voice). Following is an example of interpreted functional bass.

In this text, we primarily use the first method of Roman numerals and (prolonged) harmonic functions, since it is the most common in North American music theory. However, functional bass can be helpful for identifying categories of chords that belong together. For example, in a dictation or transcription task, we might hear *re* in the bass but not know what specific chord it is. If context tells us it is likely a dominant chord, rather than subdominant, we can label it **D2**. This rules out **II** (a subdominant chord) but keeps open multiple dominant options like **V<sup>6/4</sup>** or **VII<sup>6</sup>** until we are able to make a final determination. Similarly, when composing, there are patterns that might take an **S4**, with the specific chord (**IV** or **II<sup>6</sup>**) determined by voice-leading rather than harmonic syntax, but where a **D4** chord (**V<sup>4/2</sup>**) would be syntactically inappropriate, regardless of voice-leading.

Thus, when referring to specific chords, we will use Roman numerals to label the chords and functional labels to interpret their role in context. When referring to broader categories of chords, we will more often use functional bass.
