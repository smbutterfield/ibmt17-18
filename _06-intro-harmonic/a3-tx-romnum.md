### Harmonic Analysis:

Notes from the reading:
- parallel fifths and octaves are still not okay
  - the two notes lose independence from each other when they have PP5 and PP8
- now that we have 4 notes for 4-part harmony, we want to hear all 4 notes in the harmony
  - this avoidance of parallel fifths and octaves is completely stylistic
- circle of fifths progressions are the foundation of music 
  - the more you break traditional rules, the more you create a new style of your own
  
#### Figured Bass

Figured bass is the way we label function within a piece of music. 
It is most often used as shorthand for keyboardists.
  - also called thoughrough bass, or basso continuo
  
These pianists became great improvisors because they had a bass line and figured bass.
Everything else had to be improvised. 
They would read a bass line and see small numbers or accidentals and assume the other implied notes for the harmony.
 
It is important not to mix Lead Sheet Notation, Figured Bass, and Roman Numeral Analysis.
Firgured bass does not exist without a bass line. 
Roman numerals tell you the bass line and give us context.
Lead sheet notation gives you absolutes and tells you the exact pitches to use. 

Diatonic Qualities of Triads and Seventh Chords:

The diatonic qualities of triads and seventh chords should become automatic. 
In diatonic harmony, the minor 5 (v) in minor does not exist. 
The 5th needs the raised 7th scale degree to pull towards the tonic. 
The leading tone is the main altered tone in minor, and the reason why we have multiple forms of minor.

#### What do the parts of the Roman Numeral convey?

Roman Numerals:
- capitial: either major or augmented
- lowercase: either minor or diminished

  Both are distinguished by the quality of the 3rd of the chord. 
  
If you have an accidental in front of the Roman Numeral, that alters the root of the chord. 
An altered 5th is assumed if you alter the root of the chord. 

- inversions: when you have any inversion for a seventh chord, you no longer need the subscript 7 
  - the new figured bass takes the place of the subscript 7. 
  
Example of seventh chord consistancies:
MM7 chords in Major: I, IV
MM7 chords in Minor: III, VI

## Labeling chords ##

There are two ways in which we will label chords according to function. The first is to label chords with Roman numerals, thoroughbass figures, and functional labels. When doing so, place the appropriate Roman numeral *below* the bass line, the thoroughbass figure *above* the bass line (since it represents the upper voices), and place a functional label **T**/**S**/**D** below the Roman numeral (no **Tx**; simply call a **VI** chord **T**). For now this label can simply apply T, S, or D to individual chords; in the future, we will alter this practice slightly in order to show [functional prolongation](harmonicSyntax2.html). The first example shows individual chord functions, and the second example shows functional prolongation.

The second way to label a harmonic progression is what Quinn calls *functional bass*. Functional bass symbols combine a chord's function (**T**, **S**, **D**, or **Tx**) with an Arabic numeral denoting the scale degree of its bass note. A tonic chord with *do* in the bass is **T1**, a dominant chord with *ti* in the bass is **D7**, etc. If the bass note is chromatically altered, use a **+** or **–** to denote raised or lowered (*la* and *ti* in minor do not count, since *le*, *la*, *te*, and *ti* all belong to minor, but you can use +/– for clarity if you like). And if there is a chromatically altered note anywhere in the chord, put the functional bass symbol inside square brackets: **[S6]**, **[S+4]**, **[T–7]**, etc. (See [Chromatically altered subdominant chords](alteredSubdominants.html), [Applied chords](appliedChords.html), and [Modal mixture](modalMixture.html) for more information on common chromatically altered chords.)

Quinn also advocates using what I call *interpreted functional bass*. This nomenclature uses the same symbols, but uses parentheses to denote [*contrapuntal prolongation*](http://openmusictheory.com/harmonicSyntax2.html) and lower-case postscripts to explain the contrapuntal role of the embellishing chord (p for passing, n for neighbor, i for incomplete neighbor, d for divider, e for embellishing — all of these refer to the voice-leading pattern in the bass voice). Following is an example of interpreted functional bass.

In this text, we primarily use the first method of Roman numerals and (prolonged) harmonic functions, since it is the most common in North American music theory. However, functional bass can be helpful for identifying categories of chords that belong together. For example, in a dictation or transcription task, we might hear *re* in the bass but not know what specific chord it is. If context tells us it is likely a dominant chord, rather than subdominant, we can label it **D2**. This rules out **II** (a subdominant chord) but keeps open multiple dominant options like **V<sup>6/4</sup>** or **VII<sup>6</sup>** until we are able to make a final determination. Similarly, when composing, there are patterns that might take an **S4**, with the specific chord (**IV** or **II<sup>6</sup>**) determined by voice-leading rather than harmonic syntax, but where a **D4** chord (**V<sup>4/2</sup>**) would be syntactically inappropriate, regardless of voice-leading.

Thus, when referring to specific chords, we will use Roman numerals to label the chords and functional labels to interpret their role in context. When referring to broader categories of chords, we will more often use functional bass.
