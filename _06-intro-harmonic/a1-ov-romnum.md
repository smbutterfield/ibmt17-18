title: Overview 6a - Roman Numerals in Harmonic Analysis
---

To this point in the course, we have focused on the essential elements of music -- the building blocks of constructing and understanding music -- such as intervals, chords, and the interaction of melodies. But we have not looked at how these things combine to create harmony. To study harmony,we need a tool that labels chords and sonorities based on their context rather than their components. 

For example, leadsheet notation is a useful tool in that it conveys each essential component of a chord: root, bass note, quality, inversion, and any additional pitches. But a single leadsheet chord does not tell you anything about its role in music. 

Cmin<sup>7</sup>/E-flat

This is a chord with the pitches C, E-flat, G, and B-flat with the E-flat as the lowest voice, but it does not tell us how it relates to the chords around it. Is it stable and does it sound final? Or does it unstable and feels like it wants to lead to a different chord?

When music theorists want to discuss diatonic (key-based) function, we label chords using Roman numerals based on the chord's position within a particular key.
