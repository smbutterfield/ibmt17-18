# Class discussion

- Chords are V and I in first example
  - Easy to see root movement in bass of first three measures
  - Emphasizes the gravity of `ti` to `do` as well as `fa` to `mi`

- the 5th of the chord is the least important chord member
- the quality of the 3rd (and the 7th in a seventh chord) is more important for classifying the chord than the 5th

The V to I motion in the bass is what makes a strong cadence. 
The V to I motion in any inversion will still be strong, but not as final as each in root position.
This comes from the bass line moving from Sol up to Do. 

#### Non-Chord Tones in Cadential Motion

In C, a V - I with passing motion of G - F - E (sol - fa - mi) in the soprano line could be debated as to whether or not it is a non-chord tone. 
The F (fa) in passing motion could be considered part of the chord as an implied 7 on the V.
It also may just be a passing tone in a regular V - I. 

In C, a V4/2 - I6 with an A as an upper neighbor tone between the two chords, is not a chord tone. 
When looking for non-chord tones, you need to make sure it isn't a part of the chord. 
Looking for shapes is important, but an analysis of the surrounding chords is equally as important. 

#### Suspensions

A Suspension as a non-chord tone exists with or without ties connecting over the bar line. 
The note from the previous chord is still carried over into the new chord until it is resolved on the next beat. 
This creates a dissonance in the new chord until it is resolved soon after.

#### 3 Parts of the Suspension:

1. Preparation
2. Suspension
  - must be a non-chord tone
3. Resolution
  - must be by step in downward motion

#### Doubling:

When you have 4-part harmony and you're voicing triads, one note of the triad needs to be doubled.
- Octaves are necessary in doubling

1. Doubling the root is the ideal choice.
2. Doubling the fifth is the second best option.
3. Doubling the third is BAD. 

- You can triple the root if necessary, most commonly being used in the ending chord of the piece (often after a V7).

Doubling in a seventh chord:
- you always need the root, third, and seventh in the chord when voicing
- the fifth is omittable if necessary to avoid part writing errors

Doubling the root of the seventh chord is ideal. 

#### Spacing:
- the bass can be by itself in 4-part harmony
- tenor and alto cannot have more than an octave between them
- soprano and alto cannot have more than an octave between them

## From *Open Music Theory*

### Chord voicing

In strict keyboard-style writing, there are four voices: the bass line (which is usually a given in *basso continuo* style), and three *upper voices*: the *melody* or *soprano*, the *alto*, and the *tenor* (from highest to lowest). Since all three upper voices must be played by a single hand, they should never span more than an octave.

The melody always has an upward-pointing stem. Alto and tenor share a downward-pointing stem. If the alto and tenor share a note, that note receives a single downward-pointing stem. (See m. 1 of the example below.) If melody and alto share a note, that notehead is double-stemmed. (See m. 4 of the example below.)

When choosing the notes to place in the upper voices above a figured bass, use the bass and figures to determine the pitch classes present in the chord. (When realizing an *unfigured bass*, you must determine appropriate figures before realizing.) If the chord is a four-note chord, use each chord member once, including the bass (exceptions will be noted later). If a chord has three pitch-classes (a triad, for instance), use each pitch-class once, and "double" one of them according to the following principles:

- If the figure is 6/4, 5/3, or other chord of the fifth, double the bass pitch class.  
- If the figure is 6/3 and the bass is a *fixed scale degree* (*do*, *re*, *fa*, or *sol*), double the bass pitch class.  
- If the figure is 6/3 and the bass is a *variable scale degree* (*mi*/*me*, *la*/*le*, or *ti*/*te*) or a chromatically altered pitch, double one of the upper voices at the octave or unison.  
- Generally, do not double a variable scale degree or a chromatically altered pitch.
