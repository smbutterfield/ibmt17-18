## Introduction to Intervals

Intervals are the fundamental building blocks of melody and harmony. At their simplest,intervals need only measure the distance between two pitches, but there are many variables in music for which we must account. 

Using the examples on the next page, develop a simple explanation for our standard terminology for the:
- relationship between letter names
- relationship within the octave
- number of semi-tones between the two pitches
- specific quality in relation to the key
- general quality in the relation to the key signature
- relationship between two intervals when the upper and lower pitches are inverted
