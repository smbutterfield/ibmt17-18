## Introduction to Intervals

Intervals are the fundamental building blocks of melody and harmony. At their simplest,intervals need only measure the distance between two pitches, but there are many variables in music for which we must account.

- relationship between letter names
- relationship within the octave
- number of semi-tones between the two pitches
