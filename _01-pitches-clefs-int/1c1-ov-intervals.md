## Introduction to Intervals

Intervals are the fundamental building blocks of melody and harmony. At their simplest,intervals need only measure the distance between two pitches, but there are many variables in music for which we must account. 

Using the examples on the next page, develop a simple explanation for how we find each of the following:
- the *interval* between two pitches as represented by a numeral
- the *quality* of the interval as represented by the labels *perfect, major, minor, diminshed, and augmented*
- which *intervals* can use which *qualities*
- the hierarchy of *qualities*
- *chromatic* versus *diatonic* intervals
- *simple* versus *compound* intervals
- how the *interval* and *quality* change when the upper and lower pitches of an interval are inverted
