title: 1a Overview - Pitches and Clefs
---

Most college music students are familiar with basic music notation -- treble and bass clefs, staves, ledger lines, and accidentals -- although they are usually far more comfortable when working in the clef most associated with their primary instrument or voice-part. 
It is vital that music students be fluent in not only these two most common clefs, but also with two additional clefs: alto clef and tenor clef. These clefs are commonly used for instruments such as viola, cell, trombone, and bassoon. 
Clefs are an essential way for a composer to communicate range, so it is imperative that you become as comfortable reading music in all of the most common clefs.

Alto and tenor clefs are known as the C-clefs. 
Similarly, treble clef can be called a G-clef, and bass clef can be called an F-clef.

In the examples for this topic, use the examples on the next page to:
- the order of pitch names for each clef's lines and spaces
- why alto and tenor clefs are called C-clefs
- any tips or tricks that may make recognizing these clefs easier and reading these clefs simpler
    - Many students begin their studies of clefs by relating the unfamiliar clefs to their most familiar clef.
