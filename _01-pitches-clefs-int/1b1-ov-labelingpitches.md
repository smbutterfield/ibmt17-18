title: 1b Overview - Labeling Pitches

## Accidentals

This course assumes that you have a basic knowledge of how to raise and lower pitches in standard music notation. If you need to review proper usage of accidentals, please refer to the *Further Reading* section under the 1b Lesson.

## Enharmonic Equivalence

At its core, enharmonic equivalence is an easy concept: When two pitches sound the same -- meaning that they share identical wavelength frequencies -- but have different names, they are considered to be enharmonically equivalent. Every pitch has multiple enharmonic equivalents, but some are used less frequently due to the necessity for uncommon accidentals such as double-sharps and double-flats. Review the examples under Lesson 1b to make sure that you understand even the less common examples. Note that each of the examples has at least one more enharmonic equivalent; see if you can find them.

## Labeling Octaves

When labeling pitches, we also need a way to refer to specific octaves or registers. We will be using the system used by the International Standard Organization (ISO). In this system, middle C is labeled as C4. Using the examples under for this topic, determine:
- where C4 lies in each clef
- what the numeral refers to in this system
- how the numerals interact with letters to create a repeating system
