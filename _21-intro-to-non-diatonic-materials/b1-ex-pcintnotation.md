As we move toward music that no longer relies on standard harmony, the intricacies of how we notate music must evolve as well.

What's the difference between C-sharp and D-flat? Unit 1 and 2 were really about introducing this, although you couldn't see the importance until we started studying harmony and voice leading in Unit 6.

Explain concept of tonality requiring a difference between members of of a pitch class, but without tonality, there is no difference between members of a pitch class (Show resolutions)

Explain pitch-class labeling system using the scales from the previous page
    Two types: fixed and movable
    
    Note that this system was first laid out by Allen Forte in *The Structure of Atonal Music* and that Joseph Straus further refined this in *Introduction to Post-Tonal Theory*. Both are amazing references and if you need to explore the topic further, I recommend that you use them.
    
    We will use movable for identifying patterns, but fixed for analysis because it allows for easier analysis (opposite of the way we use solfege)

Using movable integers to identify patterns in non-diatonic scales
    Explain pitch-class sets (pcs) chords first
    
    Cardinality - number of pitches a pitch-class set contains
        empty set, monads, dyads, triads, tetrachords, penta, hexa, septa, octa, nona, deca, undeca, aggregate
    
    Then have class look at all scales to find important/common tetrachords
        Focus on 0134 0235 0245 0246
        Major: 0245 twice separated by whole step if starting second chord on fifth
            0246 occurs if starting on fourth but does not include octave
        Natural Minor: 0235 and 0135 separated by whole step
            0235 if starting on fourth
        Whole tone: 0246 at any point
